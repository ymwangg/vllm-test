{"prompt": "This is part 7 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 5 \u2013 the award of damages in respect of the amount of the builder\u2019s invoices\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with the builder\u2019s invoices as follows (at [59]):\n\n\u2026Mr Bannister provided a breakdown of costs, and I have received no break-down of costs to the contrary and he was not cross-examined in a way that causes me to reject his evidence. In the absence of any expert building evidence to the contrary, I make orders in accordance with the total contained therein. I award $29,601.69 in accordance with three invoices (Y1-Y3) for loss and damages in connection with the removal and replacement of the windows.\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in finding the appellant liable to the respondents for the amount of the three invoices from the builder, the Tribunal had:\n\nPlaced the onus of proof on the appellant in respect of proof of damage;\n\nFailed to take into account the contractual provisions regarding responsibility for waterproofing; and\n\nFailed to give adequate reasons for concluding that the work referred to in the invoices was work required in consequence of the appellant\u2019s breach of contract, that is \u201cwork required in order to bring the work into conformity with the contract\u201d.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the only evidence that the builder\u2019s work, the subject of the invoices, had anything to do with the windows, was in the wording of the invoices themselves and in contemporaneous emails from Mr Bannister\u2019s father, who had apparently prepared the invoices.\n\nThe appellant submitted:\n\nThe fact that the invoices provide some sort of \u2018breakdown of costs\u2019 does not mean that any of those costs were incurred as a result of BW\u2019s breach of contract. The Tribunal made no attempt to analyse the content of the invoices in terms of BW\u2019s contractual obligations.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal referred to the invoices as Y1-Y3, they were in fact identified as Annexures Y-7, Y-8, and Y-9. The three invoices were:\n\nAnnexure Y-7, in the amount of $10,908.70. The narration on this invoice described the work the subject of the invoice as \u201cRemove existing defective windows, existing external blinds, cladding etc, and prepare openings for the new windows; Provide adequate flashing and install windows to openings. The invoice recorded that the work involved 68 hours of labour, and also included charges of $2,485 in respect of materials, the nature of which was not specified, and $250 for pump hire.\n\nAnnexure Y-8, in the amount of $10,007.39. The narration on this invoice described the work the subject of the invoice as \u201cContinue installation of sheeting, cappings, moulding etc\u201d. The labour involved was 83 hours over a period of about two weeks. The invoice also included a charge of $653.63 in respect of \u201cmaterials\u201d with no further detail.\n\nAnnexure Y-9, in the amount of $9,092.16. This invoice included two narrations describing the work the subject of the invoice. The first narration was \u201cComplete remainder of external flashings, cappings, fix blinds, removal of scaffold\u201d in respect of which 59 hours were charged. That narration was followed by a charge of $480 for unspecified materials. The second narration was \u201cRelocated fan position, including blocking and support, relocating door handles to wet areas and patching\u201d. The invoice included a further charge of $339 in respect of unspecified materials\u201d and a second charge for labour of 14 hours. It was not clear from the invoice whether that labour related to the second narration as it appeared above the second narration.\n\nThe appellant acknowledged that the first invoice (Annexure Y-7 in the amount of $10,908.70) included the removal of existing windows and \u201cprepare openings for the new windows\u201d but submitted that \u201cthere is no breakdown in the invoice (or any other evidence) as to how many of the 68 hours [recorded on the invoice] was spent on these activities\u201d.\n\nThe appellant submitted that \u201cthe cost of repairing or replacing cladding surrounding the window openings cannot have been the result of BW\u2019s breach of contract\u201d, and that there is no indication in the invoice as to how much labour was involved in this activity. The appellant noted that it cannot be inferred that the charge for pump hire resulted from any defect in the windows installed by the appellant.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the second invoice \u201con its face has nothing to do with replacing the BW windows with Wideline windows\u201d.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the third invoice was dated 26 September, which was two and a half months after the last of the replacement windows had been installed. The appellant referred to evidence given by Mr Bannister that the reference to flashing in the invoices was a typographical error. The appellant further submitted that that there was \u201cno evidence of any causative link\u201d between the work identified in the invoice and a breach of contract by the appellant.\n\nThe appellant further submitted that, insofar as the Tribunal had held that Mr Bannister \u201cwas not cross-examined in a way that causes [the Tribunal] to reject his evidence\u201d that was not to the point, as Mr Bannister had not given evidence drawing any connection between the invoices and the windows installed by the appellant.\n\nThe respondents submitted:\n\nNo evidence to counter the Respondents\u2019 claim was tendered by the Appellant at the hearing at first instance or in this appeal to challenge the invoices, the scope of work of the builder or its relationship to any contractual obligations of the Appellant, whatever they may have been at the relevant time. The Member could only decide on the matters and evidence put before her and therefore this cannot be an error of law.\n\nFurther, the Appellant has not adduced any evidence to support its assertion that the Tribunal made no attempt to analyse the content of the invoices in terms of BW\u2019s contractual obligations.\n\nThe Appellant\u2019s legal representative had the opportunity to cross examine Jackson Bannister in relation to the invoices if the Appellant had concerns with these invoices. The Respondents submit that in such circumstances and in the absence of rebuttal evidence from the Appellant there is no error or law.\n\nIn reply, the appellant submitted that the appellant\u2019s challenge to the award of the amount of the invoices was not on the basis of their quantum (amount) but rather on the basis that the work set out in the invoices was not the result of the appellant\u2019s breach of contract; that is, it was not the cost of rectifying work for which the appellant was responsible and was not work required to achieve \u201cconformity with the contract\u201d.\n\nThe appellant submitted that, even though work which was clearly part of the rectification of the appellant\u2019s work, such as removing the windows installed by the appellant, was included in the first invoice, \u201cthe respondents bore the onus of proof in respect of the necessary apportionment of the invoice\u201d and noted that the Tribunal had not attempted any apportionment exercise.\n\nThe appellant further submitted that the installation of the new windows had been carried out by Wideline in accordance with its contract to \u201csupply and install\u201d. The appellant referred to an email from Mr Bannister\u2019s father, Neil Bannister, dated 28 June 2019, which stated \u201cso far our teams have not really assisted in the installation as there is not much to this work\u201d.\n\nThe appellant finally submitted that it was impossible to tell from the invoices whether the work done by the builder was in consequence of the removal and reinstallation of windows in January 2019 or the removal of the appellant\u2019s windows and the installation of the Wideline windows in June or July 2019. The appellant referred to the evidence of Mr Sibilia that \u201cdue to the extensive damage caused by the respondent in reinstalling the three replacement windows, building rectification work was required\u201d and pointed out that clause 2(b) of the Deed made this damage the respondents\u2019 responsibility.\n\nConsideration \u2013 Ground 5\n\nThe measure of damages for breach of contract is the amount required to put the innocent party into the position they would have been if the contract had been performed. In respect of defective building work, the measure of damages is the amount required to bring the work into conformity with the contract, provided that is a reasonable course to adopt: Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613 at 617-618.\n\nThe onus of proving that measure of damages lies upon the party seeking to recover damages.\n\nWe consider that the Tribunal made an error of law in finding the appellant liable for the amount of the builder\u2019s invoices. The Tribunal did not acknowledge that the onus of proving that the invoices reflected costs incurred by reason of the appellant\u2019s breach of statutory warranties lay upon the respondents.\n\nThe invoices did not of themselves establish that they reflected such costs and Mr Sibilia\u2019s, evidence, to which the appellant referred in its submissions in reply, suggested otherwise.\n\nAlthough the first invoice clearly includes the removal of the windows, it also includes other work and does not identify the cost of the work involved in removing the windows. As the appellant submitted, the onus of establishing the appropriate apportionment of that invoice lay upon the respondents.\n\nThe balance of the first invoice and the second and third invoices do not indicate how any of the work for which payment was claimed was related to the replacement of the defective windows.\n\nThere was no onus on the appellant to undertake cross-examination of Mr Bannister, the builder, to clarify the extent to which the invoices reflected work necessary to \u201cbring the work into conformity with the contract\u201d. Rather, the fact that the respondents did not lead evidence from Mr Bannister to clarify the content of his invoices, and to identify specifically what parts of the invoices related to work involved in the removal and replacement of the windows, gave rise to an inference that Mr Bannister\u2019s evidence on that topic would not have assisted the respondents.\n\nAs Handley JA held in Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 11 NSWLR 389 at 418F-G:\n\n\u2026 I can see no reason why those principles [arising from Jones v Dunkel] should not apply when a party by failing to examine a witness in chief on some topic, indicates \u201cas the most natural inference that the party fears to do so\u201d. This fear is then \u201csome evidence\u201d that such examination in chief \u201cwould have exposed facts unfavourable to the party\u201d: see Jones v Dunkel (at 320-321) per Windeyer J. Moreover in Ex parte Harper; Re Rosenfield [1964-5] NSWR 58 at 62, Asprey J, citing Marks v Thompson 1 NYS 2d 215 (1937) at 218, held that inferences could not be drawn in favour of a party that called a witness who could have given direct evidence when that party refrained from asking the crucial questions.\n\nMr Bannister\u2019s affidavit addressed only the testing he had undertaken to assess whether the windows installed by the appellant were leaking. The entirety of his evidence in chief concerning the invoices was given in response to a question from Mr Stack, the respondents\u2019 solicitor:\n\nMR STACK \u2013 Okay. Now, did you or someone on your behalf prepare a series of invoices for work performed and the dates of 27 June, 12 July, and 27 September 2019?\n\nMR BANNISTER \u2013 Yes.\n\nIn our view, it is clear that the evidence tendered by the respondents was not sufficient to establish that the work the subject of the invoices was work which was required to bring the work into conformity with the contract or to establish the value of the work which was such work. That conclusion is strengthened by the inference to be drawn by reason of the fact that Mr Bannister was called to give evidence and was not asked questions to establish that the work the subject of the invoices was related to the replacement of the windows.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal\u2019s decision to the extent that it awards the respondents the amount of the invoices must be set aside. In light of that conclusion it is not necessary to deal with grounds 2 or 3, which, as we have noted above, were limited to a challenge to the award of the amount of the invoices.\n\nSections 80 and 81 of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW) permit the Appeal Panel to exercise all the functions of the Tribunal at first instance and to vary a decision rather than remitting it for further hearing.\n\nWe do not consider it appropriate to remit the matter to the Tribunal for re-determination, as it would not be appropriate to allow the parties to file further evidence on any remittal hearing and, in our view, the evidence which was before the Tribunal was clearly insufficient to establish any causal link between the defects in the windows installed by the appellant and the amounts charged by the builder in the three invoices. In those circumstances it is, in our view, appropriate to vary the judgment to exclude the amount of the three invoices, that is $29,601.69.", "length": 3266}
{"prompt": "This is part 8 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\n\nGround 6 \u2013 failure to install small joint sealer\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in making a finding that the windows installed by the appellant were defective by reason of the appellant\u2019s failure to utilise small joint sealer in the remanufacture of the windows, the Tribunal had relied upon evidence from Mr Brennan\u2019s first report that he could not detect any gaskets or small joint sealer.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the Tribunal had failed to take into account concessions later made by Mr Brennan in his report in reply and in his oral evidence, that he had been wrong in his first report.\n\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sim had identified small joint sealant in the junction of the joinery pieces in the windows which had been removed and left disassembled on site. The appellant submitted that in his report in reply, Mr Brennan, at 4.4, had conceded there was evidence of sealant \u201cin some joints\u201d but that \u201csome joints were not sealed well enough\u201d.\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in cross-examination, Mr Brennan had agreed that he had assumed in his first report that no small joint sealant had been used and that there was evidence of small joint sealant in some photos included in Mr Sim\u2019s report. The appellant further submitted that Mr Brennan had \u201cconceded that he did not know whether or not the small joint sealant had been applied correctly by BW in the process of manufacture\u201d.\n\nThe respondents submitted that Mr Brennan had not conceded that the small joint sealant had been applied appropriately. The respondents referred to evidence given by Mr Brennan during the hearing that:\n\nAt some point there may have been small joint sealant in there and that was obvious later on when I had seen the other experts\u2019 reports. However, it doesn\u2019t mean it was applied correctly and evenly to every joint.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the appellant\u2019s submissions overlooked the proposition that the windows leaked through the window frames. The respondents submitted that \u201cthe absence or presence of gaskets or small joint sealer contributed to the leaks in the windows but were not the substantial cause of the problem\u201d.\n\nIn reply, the appellant noted that the respondents had conceded that the absence or presence of small joint sealer was not the substantial cause of the problem and submitted that \u201cthe absence of flashing was the substantial cause of the problem\u201d. The appellant submitted that Mr Brennan had conceded in cross-examination that he did not know whether or not there were any shortcomings in the use of small joint sealant in the manufacturing process.\n\nConsideration \u2013 Ground 6\n\nIt is clear in our view that the appellant\u2019s challenge to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant does not raise any question of law. The appellant\u2019s challenge is rather on the basis that the finding was against the weight of evidence or was not fair and equitable.\n\nThe finding of the Tribunal that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant was a finding of fact supported by the evidence of Mr Brennan. Contrary to appellant\u2019s submissions, Mr Brennan did not at any time concede that the small joint sealant had been correctly applied within the windows. His only concession was that there was apparently some sealant within the windows but he could not say whether it had been correctly applied.\n\nWe are not persuaded that the finding of the Tribunal was against the weight of evidence or not fair and equitable. There was evidence that the windows were leaking and Mr Brennan gave evidence in his initial report that one reason for the leaking windows was the absence of gaskets or small joint sealant. Although he acknowledged in his reply report and in oral evidence that there was some sealant apparent within the windows, he did not resile from his evidence that one reason for the windows leaking was the absence of small joint sealant.\n\nMoreover, in circumstances where Mr Brennan\u2019s evidence had clearly raised the issue whether gaskets or small joint sealant had been applied in the manufacture of the windows, the Tribunal was entitled to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference from the unexplained absence of evidence from any person who had been involved in the manufacture of the windows, that the evidence of any such person would not be of assistance to the appellant. By reason of that inference, the Tribunal could more readily accept the evidence of Mr Brennan that small joint sealant had not been properly installed.\n\nAccordingly, ground 6 must be rejected and leave to appeal on that ground must be refused.\n\nGround 7 \u2013 the cost of scaffolding\n\nThe appellant submitted that, in awarding $9,240 in respect of scaffolding, the Tribunal had failed to recognise that the respondents\u2019 claim in respect of scaffolding had been reduced to $3,960 at the outset of the hearing.\n\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sibilia in his evidence had initially relied upon a different document, which was an invoice dated 20 September 2019 in the amount of $9,240 for \u201cscaffolding services rendered at the above site address\u201d. The applicant submitted that that invoice clearly included charges for the hire of scaffolding for a period prior to the execution of the Deed.\n\nThe appellant submitted that the Deed released the appellant from liability in respect of the hire of scaffolding up to the date of the Deed.\n\nThe respondents submitted that the invoice for scaffolding in the sum of $9,240 was the cost incurred by the respondents in relation to the provision of scaffolding in the period after the execution of the Deed. The respondents also submitted:\n\n\u201cIn an effort to try and resolve the matter prior to the initial hearing, the respondents requested from the scaffolding company a quote for the two weeks that the scaffolding was in place to enable the appellant\u2019s replacement defective windows to be removed and new Wideline windows installed with make good, noting that the removal of scaffolding and reinstallation of the Wideline windows would have been a far more expensive exercise than having the scaffolding there the whole time. This was confirmed by Mr Sibilia in evidence in his cross examination [T1556-1558]. This quote came in at $3,960 (inc GST).\u201d\n\nThe respondents submitted that the Tribunal had awarded the sum of $9,240 \u201cas per the invoice for scaffolding as the appellant had provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary\u201d.\n\nIn the lines of the transcript of Mr Sibilia\u2019s evidence referred to by the respondents, Mr Sibilia stated in relation to the original claim of $9,240:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I paid because the scaffolding was there for the period of time that \u2013 we\u2019ve adjusted that to be \u2013 for the minimum period to cover the time between completion of windows by the [inaudible] and that\u2019s been sent through. So we\u2019ve adjusted that down.\u201d\n\nIn its reply submissions the appellant explained the issue more clearly as follows:\n\nThe respondents initially claimed $9,240 on the basis of invoice No 1742 dated 20 September 2019.\n\nShortly before the hearing, BW served its Tender Bundle which included another invoice No 1742 from the same scaffolding firm, this time dated 17 December 2018 in the sum of $4,420. BW could not have been liable for this amount, as it was before the Deed of Release. Further, the existence of two invoices with the same number made the later invoice unreliable as evidence.\n\nFaced with this, the respondents reduced their claim for scaffolding to $3,960 incl GST at the outset of the hearing. This was on the basis of a different document, a \u201cQuotation\u201d (rather than an invoice) dated 3 March 2020.\n\nAfter the hearing, the respondents in their final written submissions maintained the reduced claim for $3,960.\n\nIn relation to the quote for $3,960 the appellant submitted:\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence to support the scaffolding hire claim for $3,960, as the quote dated 3 March 2020 produced by the respondents in support of this claim was not explained in evidence. The document certainly does not speak for itself in terms of damages caused by breach of contract.\n\nConsideration \u2013 Ground 7\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in relation to the award of the cost of the scaffolding was as follows, at [59]:\n\n\u201cI accept the uncontested evidence of Mr Sibilia \u2026 that due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished. I award $9,240 for the scaffolding cost as per the invoice at Y4. I note that the respondent has provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr Sibilia had stated in his affidavit that \u201cdue to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished\u201d, no explanation was provided why it was necessary to have scaffolding in place for seven and a half months when the windows installed by the appellant were removed and the replacement Wideline windows were installed in June. In his cross-examination Mr Sibilia acknowledged (in the passage set out above) that the amount of $9,240 which the respondents had paid was for a longer period than was necessary for the removal of the defective windows and installation of the Wideline windows. The respondents had limited their claim at the hearing to the $3,960 set out in the quote and it is apparent from the transcript that he was cross-examined on the basis that the respondents\u2019 claim had been so limited.\n\nShortly after the answer set out above Mr Sibilia gave the following evidence:\n\n\u201cWe said that we would look at these from the point of view that look at your claims and work out \u2013 I mean we also have rent [inaudible] but we struck that out and we\u2019ve also looked at scaffolding and reduced it to a period of time that covers when the replacement windows were put in.\u201d\n\nThe cross-examination then moved to other topics.\n\nThe respondents sought to suggest that it would have been much more expensive to erect fresh scaffolding and take it down again. However, the quote obtained by the respondents dated 3 March 2020 - which was provided by the scaffolding contractor who had rendered the invoice dated 20 September 2019, and must therefore be taken to have been familiar with the requirements for the installation of the scaffolding \u2013 indicates that the cost would have been substantially less.\n\nThe narration to the quote is:\n\n\u201cTo supply, deliver, erect, dismantle and remove aluminium scaffolding 450kg (SWL) from the above site address\n\nTo scaffold rear of house adjacent to windows\u201d\n\nIn our view there was no evidence before the Tribunal to support the conclusion that the invoice for $9,240 was in its entirety a cost incurred in relation to the replacement of the windows. Mr Sibilia\u2019s statement in his affidavit did not go that far and his evidence in cross-examination was to the contrary. Moreover, the quotation of March 2020 clearly indicates that the amount of $9,240 was well in excess of the cost of providing scaffolding for the purpose of replacing the windows.\n\nAs we have noted above, the onus lay upon the respondents to prove their damages including providing evidence to establish the cost of the scaffolding necessary for the replacement of the windows.\n\nIn our view the award of $9,240 was either made without evidence or was against the weight of evidence and not fair and equitable. To award the respondents an amount they had explicitly not sought at the hearing would involve a substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant in circumstances where it is apparent that the cross-examination of Mr Sibilia was predicated on the fact that the respondents only sought the amount of the quote and not the whole amount paid. It follows that the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding must be set aside. To the extent necessary we would grant leave to appeal against the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding.\n\nNevertheless, we do not consider that the respondents should receive nothing for the cost of scaffolding. Mr Dalgleish suggested at the hearing of the appeal that an allowance of $1,000 would be appropriate. However, we consider that there is evidence of the cost of providing scaffolding for the removal and replacement of the windows. We do not accept the appellant\u2019s submission that the quotation of 3 March 2020 is not evidence of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows. That document was provided by the contractor who had provided scaffolding for the construction project and correctly identified the relevant site and the location of the windows which required replacement.\n\nWhether or not the document would meet the requirements for admissibility under the Evidence Act, the laws of evidence do not apply in the Tribunal. We consider that the quotation is sufficient evidence to establish that the appropriate compensation in respect of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows was $3,960 inclusive of GST.\n\nWe note in this context that the quote included the cost of erection and dismantling of the scaffolding, which were costs in respect of which the builder had invoiced the respondents in the third of the builder\u2019s invoices. As we have not allowed the respondents any compensation in respect of the builder\u2019s invoices, there is no risk of double counting in awarding the respondents the full value of the quotation.\n\nAccordingly, we will reduce the judgment sum by a further $5,280 (the difference between $9,240 and $3,960).\n\nWe note that the amount awarded by the Tribunal, $50,771.69, is $2,090 less than the sum of the three amounts which the respondents claimed. This discrepancy was not explained in the decision. It is not necessary to explore that matter further. The amount to which we consider the respondents were entitled was $14,020 in respect of the supply of the windows and $3,960 for scaffolding. The sum of those figures is $17,980, which is the amount to which we will vary the amount of the judgment.", "length": 3543}

Madelyn Cline and Chase Stokes have broken down how they kept their real-life romance and split from affecting their roles on Outer Banks.\n\nThe Netflix series, which debuted in April 2020, introduced viewers to a coastal town in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which is divided into wealthy and working-class sides. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers accidentally find themselves at the center of a dangerous treasure hunt.\n\nDuring the first season, John B (Stokes) and Sarah (Cline) developed a romantic relationship even though they were divided by their social status. At the time, fans questioned whether Stokes and Cline\u2019s connection developed into something more off screen.\n\nAfter going public, the Maryland native recalled how he and the Glass Onion star initially tried not to act on their feelings.\n\n\u201cAt that point in time, we were so anxious about the show and so nervous about constantly screwing up. I think we were all under this sort of strange umbrella of, like, \u2018Dear God, we got an opportunity. Let\u2019s not screw it up!\u2019 So, it was just always work-oriented \u2014 really until the day we wrapped,\u201d he exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2021. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after that, until we started to kind of get into the [coronavirus] lockdown where we were like, \u2018Is there something here or am I crazy?\u2019 That\u2019s sort of where it bloomed from there. I think we were just so invested in the work.\u201d\n\nUs confirmed in November 2021 that the pair had called it quits after more than one year of dating. The news came after season 2 was released on the streaming service. Since then, Cline has been linked to Zack Bia and later Jackson Guthy. Stokes, for his part, was spotted packing on the PDA with Kelsea Ballerini following her divorce from Morgan Evans.\n\nAhead of Outer Banks\u2018 season 3 release, the former couple discussed how they have \u201calways shown up for each other\u201d at work. Showrunner Jonas Pate also praised Stokes and Cline for focusing on their job since their split.\n\n\u201cHonestly, and this isn\u2019t just me: they\u2019re pros,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly in February 2023. \u201cThey handled themselves unbelievably on set, and you would never know that they had an off-camera relationship. They were great. It\u2019s a credit to Chase and to Maddie, they just put their heads down and did the work, so good for them.\u201d\n\nThat same month, the model revealed how her relationship with Stokes affected her dating life going forward, telling Cosmopolitan, \u201cI am a really private person. There\u2019s a part of me that is for me and nobody else. But in hindsight, duh, making my relationship public made it everybody else\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cAnd I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn\u2019t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy. People see the need for sides. There are no sides \u2014 there\u2019s no winning or losing in a breakup.\u201d\n\nBusiness As Usual\nIn February 2023, the pair praised their ability to keep their focus on Outer Banks.\n\n\"Mads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first,\" the actor told EW. \"And that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, that we're always going to honor the work. That stayed 100 percent truthful this season.\"\n\nStaying Professional\n\"We had a working relationship before we had a personal relationship, and our job from day one has always been to leave the show better than we found it,\" the Vice Principals alum shared with EW. \"I'm really, really happy, and I'm very proud of the work this season, and I'm incredibly grateful for my costars and their professionalism and just how talented each and every one of them are.\"\nFocusing on Their Craft\nCline explained how she was able to stay on good terms with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"We always said that the job remains untouched. Nothing else, personal or negative, will touch the job,\" she said to Cosmopolitan in February 2023. \"And while that\u2019s not always easy, our job is to leave the show better than we found it, to leave the season better than we found it. And I\u2019m really appreciative of that.\"\n\nNetflix stars Chase Stokes and Madelyn Cline are able to keep things professional when it comes time to film Outer Banks. The former couple has spoken at length about separating their real-life relationship from work when stepping on set as John B and Sarah Cameron! While they\u2019ve since split, the Netflix stars are still able to keep things professional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun to drive together to work, come home and throw ideas off of each other about different scenes, collaborating, watching her get excited about her work and be her cheerleader,\u201d Chase told People in March 2021 about working alongside his real-life love. \u201cThe beautiful thing for us is that our relationship was established as friends and coworkers prior to what we have now. The biggest difference now is I get to be even more proud of her as my partner when I watch her work.\u201d\n\nThe actors first met when they were cast as the protagonists in Netflix\u2019s Outer Banks. After the show premiered its first season in April 2020, fans were quick to speculate that Chase and Madelyn were more than just friends off screen. It wasn\u2019t until June 2020 when they confirmed their relationship. At the time, Chase uploaded an Instagram photo with his girlfriend alongside a caption that read, \u201cCat\u2019s outta the bag.\u201d\n\nAs for how they went from coworkers to something more? Chase explained to Us Weekly in February 2021 that \u201cit was just always work-oriented \u2014 really until the day we wrapped.\u201d Once they finished filming season 1, things turned romantic.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until after that, until we started to kind of get into the lockdown where we were like, \u2018Is there something here or am I crazy?\u2019\u201d the actor recalled to Us Weekly. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of where it bloomed, from there. I think we were just so invested in the work.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time for Chase and Madelyn to bring their newfound relationship back to the Outer Banks set for season 2, costar Julia Antonelli (who plays Wheezie Cameron) told J-14 exclusively in July 2021 that they\u2019re \u201cso cool together\u201d on set.\n\n\u201cThey are literally the cutest together. Honest to God. They\u2019re so cute,\u201d she gushed. \u201cThey\u2019re so chill, and it\u2019s just cool to see them. They get along so well. So, it\u2019s just awesome to see them like chilling on set together. That\u2019s really cute because, of course, they\u2019re dating in the show as well.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, multiple reports in November 2021 confirmed that the couple had called it quits. Scroll through our gallery to read Chase and Madelyn\u2019s quotes about how they worked together on Outer Banks.\n\nNo Crossover on Set\n\u201cWe always said that the job remains untouched. Nothing else, personal or negative, will touch the job. And while that\u2019s not always easy, our job is to leave the show better than we found it, to leave the season better than we found it. And I\u2019m really appreciative of that,\u201d Madelyn explained to Cosmopolitan in February 2023, noting that she doesn\u2019t \u201cowe anyone an explanation.\u201d\n\nOverall, she had some regrets about showing the relationship online.\n\n\u201cMaking my relationship public made it everybody else\u2019s business,\u201d the actress added. \u201cAnd I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn\u2019t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy.\u201d\n\nReturning for Season 3\n\u201cMads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first,\u201d Chase told Entertainment Weekly in February 2023 about their past relationship. \u201cAnd that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, that we\u2019re always going to honor the work. That stayed 100 percent truthful this season.\u201d\n\nMadelyn, for her part, added, \u201cWe had a working relationship before we had a personal relationship, and our job from day one has always been to leave the show better than we found it. I\u2019m really, really happy and I\u2019m very proud of the work this season, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful for my costars and their professionalism and just how talented each and every one of them are.\u201d\n\nKeeping It Professional\n\u201cWe\u2019re both professionals. We always have been since day one,\u201d Madelyn told W Magazine in August 2022 about working alongside Chase. \u201cOuter Banks is a big family, and at the end of the day, we show up, we\u2019re professional, and we do our jobs.\u201d\n\nOn the Same Page\nMadelyn explained that the couple \u201claid the groundwork first and foremost\u201d before heading back to set.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018This is a big priority to me, and you know, from what I know based on how you work, it is for you too. But I want to make sure that we hold each other accountable and that we don\u2019t bring anything personal that could potentially distract each other or our fellow castmates on the day,\u2019\u201d she said during an August 2021 appearance on The Talk. \u201cSo, it wasn\u2019t hard at all, and I really respect that about him and our relationship.\u201d\n\nSeparating Work and the Relationship\nDuring the same talk show appearance, Madelyn noted that \u201cmy workspace was incredibly sacred.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very personal to me and I do not like to bring any sort of personal troubles to my workspace,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m kind of notorious for even turning my phone off and not answering it for hours, or just like leaving it in my trailer, because I like to focus on what\u2019s in front of me. I\u2019m very much of a one-track mind kind of person.\u201d\n\nNo Issues on Set\n\u201cMadelyn and I are very transparent about our relationship and we keep our personal stuff at home,\u201d the heartthrob told Fashion Week Daily in August 2021. \u201cObviously, we spent a lot of time together, so there\u2019s definitely some that leaks through! And that\u2019s totally fine. But it\u2019s fun to create characters that are not ourselves, and then make different decisions than what we would probably normally make. So it\u2019s fun; it\u2019s a lot of fun to sort of dive into a different world.\u201d\n\nDifferentiating Their Real-Life and Onscreen Romance\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of attention on our relationship outside of the show in the off season. We recognize that. And we recognize that it\u2019s incredibly important to separate ourselves from the characters,\u201d Chase told Decider in July 2021. \u201cThis season was a lot of thought for her and I to make these characters different. \u2026 So, we definitely made sure that there\u2019s a difference between the two, especially as we go through our careers. We don\u2019t want to be seen as just single-minded or linear. We want to be multi-faceted and be able to do things outside of John B and Sarah. So it\u2019s great, but I think we\u2019re very conscious of making sure those characters live in a different world than Maddie and Chase do.\u201d\n\nA Great Relationship\n\u201cWe have a very healthy relationship because it started with the work first,\u201d Chase explained while chatting with V Man in July 2021. \u201cFor season 2, as soon as we get to work, we\u2019ll support each other. We\u2019ll be scene partners and take care of each other when it\u2019s an emotional moment. But it doesn\u2019t mean that if I don\u2019t believe you, that I\u2019m not going to call you out and she holds me to the same standard. Then, as soon as we get back to our trailers and we\u2019re taking off our makeup and character clothes, it\u2019s like that world disappears. I\u2019m very thankful for her and the journey we\u2019re on, it\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\nGetting Into Character\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re an accountant, whether you work in marketing or you\u2019re an engineer, if you work with your partner, you kinda gotta put it all aside and just go to work and do your job,\u201d Chase explained to Life & Style in July 2020. \u201cIt works out.\u201d", "length": 3102}

{"prompt": "from the following word what is pos tagging and explain rule based tagger and hybrid tagger in bullet points. keep it short It is the process of assigning a part-of -speech to each word in a sentence.\n\n\u2022 The input to a tagging algorithm is sequence of words of natural language sentence and specified tag sets(a\nfinite list of part of speech tags).The output is a single best part of speech tag for each word. Many words\nbelong to more than one lexical category.\n\n\u2022 For example, the english word 'book' can be a noun as in 'I am reading a good book\u2019 or a verb as in 'The\npolice booked the snatcher\u2019. For example, the hindi word 'sona' may mean 'gold'(noun)or 'sleep'(verb).\n\n\u2022 In tagging, to determine the correct lexical category depends on its context. The collection of tags used by a\nparticular tagger is called a tag set. Most parts of speech tag sets make use of some basic categories ,i.e noun,\nverb, adjective, preposition.\n\n\u2022 Tag sets differ in how they define categories and how finely they divide words into categories.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\u2219 Most tag set capture morpho-syntactic information such as singular/plural, number, gender, tense ,etc.\n\u2219 Consider the following sentence:\n\u2022 Zuhu eats an apple daily\n\u2022 Aman ate an apple yesterday\n\u2022 They have eaten all the apples in the basket\n\u2022 I like to eat guavas.\nThe word eat has many forms.\neat \u2013 base form\n\nate \u2013 past tense\neats \u2013 third person singular subject\neaten \u2013 past participle form\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nThe number of tags used by different taggers varies subsequently, some use 20 while others use 400.\n\u2219 Penn Treebank tag set \u2013 47 tags\n\u2219 C7 \u2013 164\n\u2219 TOSCA ICE \u2013 270 tags\n\u2219 TESS \u2013 200 tags\nLarger tag set\n\ngreater the information captured about linguistic context.\nTask of tagging become more complicated and requires manual correction.\nA bigger tag set can be used for morphologically rich languages without introducing too many tagging errors.\nA tag set that uses just one tag to denote all the verbs will assign identical tags to all the forms of a verb.\nCoarse grained distinction:- appropriate for some tasks.\n\u2022 Fine grained tag set:-captures more information\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nTags From Penn Treebank Tag Set\n\nVB \u2013 verb, base form\nVBD \u2013 verb, past tense\nVBG \u2013 verb, gerund or present participle\nVBN - verb, past participle.\nVBP - verb, non third person singular present\nVBZ \u2013 verb, third person singular present\nPossible Tags For The Word To Eat\n\n\u2022 Eat \u2013 VB\n\u2022 Ate - VBD\n\n\u2022 Eaten \u2013 VBN\n\u2022 Eats \u2013 VBP\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\nParts of speech tagging is an early stage of text processing in many NLP application like:\n\u2219 Speech synthesis\n\u2219 Machine translation\n\u2219 Information retrieval\n\n\u2219 Information extraction.\n\nParts of speech tagging methods has 3 categories.\n\n1. Rule based(linguistic)\n2. Stochastic (data driven)\n3. Hybrid.\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\u2022 Rule Based Taggers\nUse hand coded rules to assign tags to words. These rules use a lexicon to obtain a list of candidate tags and then use rules to\ndiscard incorrect tags.\nHave a 2 stage architecture:\nFirst stage is simply a dictionary look up procedure, which returns a set of potential tags and appropriate syntactic features for\neach word.\nSecond stage uses a hand coded rules to discard contextually illegitimate tags to get a single part of speech for each word.Eg:\nThe noun-verb ambiguity.\n\nThe show must go on.\n\nThe potential tags for the word show in this sentence is {VB,NN}.\n\nIf preceding word is determiner THEN eliminate VB tags. This rule simply disallows verb after a determine using this rule the\nword show is noun only.\n\u2022 In addition to contextual information, many taggers use morphological information to help in the disambiguation process.\nIf word ends in \\_ing and preceding word is a verb THEN label it a verb(VB).\nThe dog is running in the...\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nRule based tagger require supervised training\nInstead rules can be induced automatically\nTo induce rules, untagged text is run through a tagger\nThe output is then manually corrected\nThe corrected text is then submitted to the tagger, which learns correction rules by comparing the 2 sets of\ndata. This process may be repeated several times.\n\nTAGGIT (Greene and Rubin 1971) :- Initial tagging of Brown Corpus(Francis and Kucera 1982). Rule\nbased s/m, it uses 3,300 disambiguation rules and able to tag 77% of the words in the Brown Corpus with\ntheir correct part of speech.\nAnother rule based tagger is ENGTWOL (voutilainen 1995)\n\nParts of Speech Tagging\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2219 Speed, deterministic than stochastic\n\u2219 Arguments against them is the skill and effort required in writing disambiguation rules\n\u2219 Stochastic taggers require manual work if good performance is to be achieved\n\u2219 Rule based, time is spent in writing a rule set\n\u2219 Stochastic, time is spent developing restriction on transitions and emissions to improve tagger performance\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\u2219 It\u2019s usable for only one language.

{"prompt": "Here Damian! This is another example of my technical writing, please analyze the style, science, and rhetoric that I used. Really get to know my writing style with this one:\n\"\nThe field of neural prosthetics has made great strides in the last few decades, from deep brain stimulators to neural prosthetics. As programs such as the Brain Initiative push for revolutionizing the understanding of the brain, the once electrical engineering-dominated field of neural prosthetics has become rich with diversity, with computer science and biochemistry researchers joining together to better the tools needed to advance neuroscience as a whole. \nThe field of neural prosthetics aims to restore function to damaged portions of the nervous system via assistive devices. Typically, assistive devices are electrical stimulators that can modulate the behavior of the nervous system to alleviate ailments. An example of such a device is deep brain stimulation electrodes used in treating Parkinson\u2019s Disease patients[.1]. Multiwire electrodes such as the Utah array or Michigan probes have long been a staple of neural prostheses due to their reliability[2.3]. However, the devices still fall victim to the most pertinent problem that the field currently faces. The growth of fibrotic tissue around the implanted electrode sites causes instability and limited throughput of the tissue-electrode interfaces [4.5]. It has been shown that electrode arrays can typically be practical for up to one year before needing to be replaced[6.].\n While Utah arrays and Michigan probes allow for stable recordings for a decent amount of time, the deterioration of electrodes proves to be a hindrance. To create a more stable neural implant, two methods can be utilized: creating an imperceptible implant to the native host tissue or creating an indistinguishable implant [7.]. The first method would circumvent the immune response by using materials that cannot be detected. Therefore, no foreign body reactions would occur. The second method aims to create an implant that mimics the surrounding tissue and circumvents foreign body reactions. Implants made utilizing these methods should be capable of long-term placement in patients with no physical or signal degradation over time.\nConventional electrode-based neural interfaces face the problem of developing fibrotic tissue over time. However, nanoscale functional neural interfaces (nFNIs) show the potential to circumvent foreign body reactions due to their nanoscale. Functional neural interfaces (FNIs) are transducers that can relay signals between the nervous system and external stimulation and monitoring systems. Typically these transducers absorb and emit forms of energy such as electricity, magnetic fields, light, ultrasound, heat, or mechanical and relay these signals to or from the nervous system. Their bidirectional communication with the nervous system enables observations of neural activity and stimulation. As the field moves forward, FNIs are becoming miniaturized, allowing for more stable interfaces, higher-resolution communication, and more efficient signal transduction [7.]. Utah arrays can detect and induce local field potentials, affecting nearby neurons. Still, if FNIs were to become miniaturized, the spatial resolution of FNIs could be on an individual neuron scale. \nAnother perk of nFNIs is their undetectability. The host tissue will have a significantly harder time detecting the foreign bodies on a nanoscale. Foreign body reactions occur when macrophages and neutrophils cover the implanted device, causing foreign-body giant cells to grow. However, nFNIs would be magnitudes smaller than these cells. Therefore, it would be impossible for foreign body reactions to encapsulate them[8.]. Assuming the nFNIs can be effectively anchored to the target neuron and not toxic, nFNIs would have increased stability in vivo over time[9.]. \nCurrently, there exists a tradeoff between invasiveness and spatial resolution. The process is noninvasive for techniques such as electroencephalography(EEG), but the device can only interpret which brain regions are being activated. In contrast, devices such as the Utah array, which consists of 100 microelectrodes, can receive local field potentials from multiple sites. Still, it requires highly invasive surgery performed by specialists for their placement. nFNIs could potentially be dispersed by injection. The procedure is minimally invasive, and it offers the benefit of reducing the risk of infection, allowing for less specialized practitioners to administer the injection. However, injection has the inherent risk of the nFNIs not arriving at the targeted neurons. The bloodstream could take the nFNIs to parts of different regions of the brain or body that are unintended, which is a risk that the two other methods do not have. \n\nFigure 1: The figure on the left compares conventional noninvasive stimulation compared to nFNI assisted stimulation. In both cases, the signal attenuates as it travels through tissue and bone, eventually reaching the target neuron. On the left, the neuron is not activated, but on the right, the nFNI can transduce the signal sufficiently enough to create an action potential in the neuron. The figure on the right shows a closeup of the nanoparticle linked to the plasma channel affecting the ion channel.\nNon-invasive stimulation is the technique of modulating the brain\u2019s activity externally via transmitted signals. Currently, magnetic signals (transcranial magnetic stimulation), electrical signals (transcranial electrical stimulation), and ultrasound signals (transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation) are the primary noninvasive stimulation being used in practice. However, as a signal is sent through a medium such as tissues and bones, the signal will dissipate and scatter, which is a significant hurdle for non-invasive stimulation. As shown in Figure 1, nFNIs could help alleviate these issues by delivering a localized signal to the target neuron. The nFNI would receive the external signal in its attenuated/scattered form. While the signal itself would generally be insufficient in activating the ion channel, as shown on the left, the nFNI would convert the primary signal into a secondary signal capable of activating the ion channel at lower energies. Another perk of this system is that it allows different neurons to be targeted with different nFNIs, allowing for different stimulation targets based on the oscillation frequency. Therefore, The primary-secondary approach would allow for highly targeted, tunable neurons, improved signal transduction, and greater flexibility for signal choice. \nWith the primary-secondary approach, individual neurons could be targeted with external stimulation compared to broadly stimulating a brain region. The specific targeting would be possible because the nFNIs would be bound close to a neuron. If a primary signal not capable of stimulating neurons is applied to the brain, the localized secondary signal delivered by the attached nFNI would, in theory, compactly transduce the signal effectively enough to cause an action potential. The approach would allow for enhanced targeting of specific neurons and require a weaker primary signal, meaning the instrument\u2019s size can be reduced. \nCurrently, acoustic, magnetic, and optical signals are the main primary signals being investigated. The secondary, electrical, magnetic, thermal, optical, and mechanical signals have shown promise in modulating neurons[7.]. \nFigure 2: In the above figure, three examples of nanotransducers are shown. The first example depicts a magnetoelectric transducer. The primary signal, magnetic energy, is sent to the nanoparticle, and the secondary signal of electrical energy is sent to the local area. The second example depicts an optical transducer. The primary signal is electromagnetic radiation (UV light), and the secondary signal, visible light, is sent to the local area. Lastly, the third example depicts a piezoelectric transducer. The primary signal in this example could be ultrasound or microwaves, converted to electricity in the local area. \n Biomimicry is an essential step in the implementation of an exemplary neural interface. To establish effective signal transduction, neural interfaces must use similar communication mechanisms as the neurons they are influencing. Binding to the plasma membrane, ion channels, and intracellular stimulation are the three feasible mechanisms with nFNIs. \n\nFigure 3: The above figure shows three methods of binding a nanoparticle to a neuron. The first method, depicted by (1), shows an anchoring protein binding the nanoparticle to the plasma membrane. The second method, depicted by (2), is the nanoparticle being bound to the ion channel. The third method, depicted by (3), shows the nanoparticles intracellularly.\nOf the three mechanisms, binding to the ion channels is the most practical route because signals can be obtained or delivered efficiently to the neuron while avoiding endocytosis. They also allow for direct stimulation of the neuron by inducing an action potential in the axon or dendrites. Because nFNIs can theoretically target ion channels on an individual level, they can achieve realistic communication with the neurons, reducing potential injuries and allowing for higher resolution, communication bandwidth, and signal channels[7.].\nIn this paper, a survey of current nFNIs will be conducted. The goal is to identify nFNIs with the potential to transduce primary external energy to secondary energy in a manner capable of altering neural activity. Ideally, the discovered nFNIs could be used practically and ethically within humans as building blocks for a theoretical brain-computer interface. The system would aim to solve the two problems of FNI stability and signal resolution today, and an analysis of the advancements in the field needed to make such a design practical will also be conducted. \nPrimary Signals\nDeciding the correct primary signal is a fundamental step in implementing nFNIs. If the primary signal attenuates too quickly or cannot deliver enough energy, the nFNI will be incapable of producing a sufficient secondary signal to stimulate the neuron. Likewise, if the signal cannot be detected on a near-nanoscale spatial resolution, signals received from individual neurons may be lost. Electromagnetic, ultrasound and magnetic stimulation are the three signal types that will be evaluated in the proceeding section.\n Electromagnetic radiation exists on a spectrum from radio waves to gamma rays; as the wavelength of the radiation decreases, the energy of the wave increases. Due to this, short wavelength electromagnetic radiation such as gamma rays to UV light can prove potentially dangerous in a biological system. X-rays and Gamma rays are classified as ionizing radiation because they can remove electrons from atoms. The removal of these electrons can cause tissue damage or cancer if DNA is damaged[10.]. \n A study done in LEDs at different wavelengths shows that near-infrared wavelengths allow greater signal depth due to their longer wavelengths. However, as the wavelengths increased beyond 900nm, the signal depth began to decline, as shown in Table 1. A range of 700-900nm seems the optimal range for the primary signal to reach the maximum depth of roughly 4.4mm in tissue. Based on this information, the NIR range seems an optimal candidate as an optical light primary energy. In a study conducted on mice, NIR imaging was capable of penetrating 2mm through the skull[11.]. The NIR is 2mm due to light scattering, but despite the scattering, the signal has a spatial resolution of sub-10 \u00b5m through the skull[11.].\nWavelength\n300-400nm\n550-650nm\n650-750nm\n700-900nm\n1000nm\n10600nm\nPenetration Depth\n<1mm\n1.5-2mm\n2.5-3mm\n4.2-4.4mm\n3mm\n<1mm\n\nTable 1: A comparison of LED wavelengths vs. penetration depth [12.13]\nMicrowaves are the band of electromagnetic radiation on the higher frequency end of the radio spectrum[14.]. Microwaves are used for many applications such as point-to-point communications, heat sources, and, more recently, medical imaging. Microwave Imaging(MWI) is an emerging imaging method that has shown several advantages over other methods such as x-ray, ultrasound, and MRI due to its lower cost, use of non-ionizing radiation, and imaging without the use of contrasting agents[14.]. MWI is primarily used in imaging soft tissues such as breasts to find tumors. MWI works by microwaves penetrating the skin and tissue in order to reach a receiver on the opposite side. While traveling through the tissue, the waves scatter due to the different electrical properties of the different tissues, which can be interpreted with algorithms once received by the receiver. As shown in table 2, microwaves between the frequencies of 800 to 1000 MHz can penetrate the skull, with 40% of these waves able to reach 4-5cm into the brain[15.]. The resolution of microwaves depends on the amount of antenna used in a given setup. A spatial resolution of 4mm is the resolution that will be considered. The resolution comes from a study that used MWI to image the brain of rhesus monkeys[16.]. \nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive form of stimulation that relies on electromagnetic induction to stimulate muscles and nerves. Current is carried through the circular or figure-eight shaped coils, which creates a powerful, pulsing magnetic field on the scalp, which induces an electrical current in the target region of the brain.[17.]TMS has been limited to 2-5 cm due to rapid electric field attenuation, but it has been shown that it can stimulate up to 6-8 cm with other coil designs such as double-cone, halo, or H coils[17.]. However, the high intensities needed from these depths raise safety concerns and may cause discomfort[17.]. The reported discomfort ranges from headaches and local pain, which can be attributed to the activation of nerves and nociceptors on the scalp[18.]. TMS has been shown to have a spatial resolution of 0.5-1 cm, meaning it cannot stimulate specific neural circuits or neurons, unlike the spatial resolutions of NIR light and ultrasound, as shown below in Table 2. However, it can stimulate specific brain regions, such as the visual, temporal, and motor cortices. \n\"", "length": 3422}

{"prompt": "hi everyone I hope you're all doing really well and for those of you who don't know me I'm Malin about a year ago I shared a salad recipe here on the channel That Roman I was obsessed with at the time and I thought this year mustn't be any different and we should stick to tradition so I'm back with another salad that we have been making in different Renditions for years now and this version is the best yet I think and I want to give it our full attention today it has a few different components prepared in different ways and this is the way to a good salad I think and if you want to learn more about the science let's call it behind how I compose salads you can check out a video we made called six easy steps to level up your salads that we posted last year and I'll link that down below for you if you want to see it now this salad has a base of crunchy veg that will be topped with a delicious sticky Ginger tofu as well as some nuts and coriander and spring onion for more interest first I'll show you how to make some quick pickled chilies though that will go on top of the salad at the end and this is a really good technique to learn because it works for any quick pickle that you want to make but before we get into that I want to thank Squarespace for sponsoring this video and tell you a little bit more about them Squarespace is an all-in-one website builder with lots of great tools to make it easy to build a beautiful and well-functioning site without any previous knowledge about coding or website building personally I've used Squarespace to create my online food photography portfolio and I really like that it is so easy and intuitive to use there are plenty of themes fun combinations and color combos on Squarespace to get you started and there are themes for many different purposes so it's great for everyone from business owners and e-commerce all the way to creatives and bloggers so if you're thinking about creating a website for any purpose check out squarespace.com for a free trial and when you're ready to launch your site go to squarespace.com forward slash good eatings for 10 of your first website or domain all right so let's begin and why I like to start by making the quick pickle is because it needs to sit for preferably an hour before we tuck into it or top the salad with it and you could also make it a day ahead of making the salad itself and it will keep in the fridge for about a week or two weeks even if you don't end up using it all for the salad now and it's a very simple process which starts with two nondescript long green chilies like these that are mild here in Sweden these chilies are just called green chilies in the store so I can't give you more of an indication but you could use jalapenos if you can't find this variety and I use two whole green peppers for this recipe that serves four people once I've sliced the peppers up I just transfer them into a jar and then I prepare a very basic pickling liquid I add one quarter cup of water to a small saucepan along with one quarter cup of rice vinegar then I add a quarter of a teaspoon of sugar and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt then over low medium heat I just warm it up and whisk it until the sugar has dissolved it doesn't need to come to a boil or anything you just warm it until it's dissolved and then pour it over the peppers once all the liquid is in there I like to give the sliced chilies a quick prod just to coat them all in the liquid and then I let them sit while I prep the rest of the recipe so now with the pickle pickling away I will move on to prepping the tofu is this the marinade or glaze for that is very similar to the dressing that goes for the crunchy veg in the base of the salad I like to prepare them at the same time so I've just grabbed two bowls here and I think these little adjustments when you cook is how you can save a little bit of time and become more efficient in the kitchen so if you ever see that some components in a recipe you are using it has the same ingredients then prepare them at the same time it just makes it easier for yourself and that's what I will do and the tofu I'm using is extra firm tofu because it has a little less water in it and will have that nice and firm texture that I'm looking for in this recipe without us having to press it beforehand so what I do is that I just simply Pat it dry with a clean towel you could do this with paper towels if you prefer and if you are using plain firm tofu you could press it for about half an hour to get rid of any excess liquid the block of tofu I'm using here is 400 grams worth and once it's all nice and dry I cut it into four equal sized pieces then I slice each one of those pieces into four slices roughly half a centimeter thick but of course you could cut these into cubes if you prefer or cut them into any shape you like it really doesn't matter all that much as long as you fry them on all sides later once the tofu is all sliced up I transfer it into a shallow bowl and try to place it in a single layer as well as I can then I spread one tablespoon of corn starch over the surface and then cover the tofu in the cornstarch as evenly as possible this will ensure that the tofu gets a nice crispy surface when we fry it later I set the coated tofu aside and get started with the marinade and the dressing and both of these need fresh ginger so first I make sure to peel it and I like to use a teaspoon for this it's just such a great way to peel Ginger trust me if you've never tried it yourself then I like to grate the ginger on a micro plane but you could use a box grater or any other grating apparatus that you like you could even chop it finely if you prefer to get started with the dressing I transfer one teaspoon of the grated Ginger into one of my bowls and then I mince one clove of garlic into that bowl as well again I like to use my garlic press for this but you could mince it with a knife if you find that easier next I add in three tablespoons of soy sauce or you could use tamari as a gluten-free option I also add in two tablespoons of rice vinegar which gives a nice acidity to the dressing for some nuttiness I add in one tablespoon of toasted sesame oil then to round it out I add in one tablespoon of olive oil as well I'm also adding in one tablespoon of maple syrup for a bit of sweetness and finally I'm squeezing in the juice of half a large lime which gives this dressing a little extra thing and then I just mix that all up to combine and set it aside this will give the flavors and the dressing some time to all come together and marry before we add them to the veggies next I prepared the marinade or glaze we could call it for the tofu and I add the remaining two teaspoons of grated Ginger to the other Bowl along with one minced garlic clove I pour in two tablespoons of soy sauce or tamari as well as one teaspoon of maple syrup one teaspoon of toasted sesame oil and one teaspoon of rice vinegar finally I go in with half a teaspoon of chili flakes for a little bit of heat and then I mix it all up and that's the marinade done and I will set it aside while I fry up the tofu first so I heat up about two tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium Heat then I add the coated tofu slices in a single layer and fry them for about four or five minutes on one side until they're nice and golden then I flip them and fry them for about three or so minutes on the other side or until they're golden on both sides you might think this seems like I'm doing things the wrong way around since I haven't really flavored them yet but you will see how they soak up all the flavor from the marinade when I add it to the skillet usually at this point the frying pan is very hot so I do the step with the heat off so when the tofu is golden on both sides I pour the marinade over it and then toss the tofu in the marinade and let it cook into the surface of it if you find that the marinade isn't becoming sticky and sticking to the tofu itself you might want to turn the heat back on what you want is for it all to be absorbed by the tofu and for it to get a nice surface so when I take the tofu off the heat I like to just let it sit in the pan still on the residual heat while I prep the veg because now the two sort of main topping players are all done and we are going to do the salad base and of course you could start with the veg but I like them to be as fresh as possible when I serve the salad so I always do it last to retain as much crunch as possible and I'm using great winter veg here like cabbages and carrot and prepping them in a way that is still fresh and a little summery if you will of course you could use other veg in here as well if you are in a different season to me then of course you could use cucumbers or courgettes or whatever other veg that you think will go well with this crunchy salad anyways in my salad there will also be fresh coriander and spring onion running through it all though to give it a little more Pizzazz and I'm going to use a not very seasonal vegetable too which is a bell pepper to add some more color and vibrancy and also a little bit of sweetness it is all very straightforward really so let's prep the veg and start building the finished dish if you wanted to you could Shred the cabbage with a mandolin but for this recipe I personally usually chop the Cabbage a little bit rougher so I prefer to use a knife and to serve four people I chop up four cups worth of the white cabbage and then I transfer it into a large mixing bowl next up I chop up two cups worth of the purple cabbage in the same manner that I did the white cabbage and then I move on to the bell pepper cutting around the core to remove the flesh from the core itself and then I like to julienne it using my knife just slicing it into little batons [Music] then I move on to the carrot which I will also julienne but for this I like to use a julienne peeler and you could peel the carrot before or not it's really up to you then I just slice along the carrot lengthways with the julienne peeler to create these long strips if you don't have a julienne peeler you could simply grate the carrot using a box grater or cut it with a knife I actually like to cut them into shorter battons anyway just so that they mix into the other vegetables nicely and for this mix I like to use about a cup and a half of carrot then I clean some spring onion that I will slice up into thin slices and I use about three quarter cup in the salad but I also like to set some aside that I can sprinkle over the top of the salad later as a topping the last ingredient going into the veg space for the salad is fresh coriander and I like to chop up a Cup's worth of the leaves just roughly again it can be nice to set aside some whole leaves for topping the salad with at the end as well finally I just transferred the spring onion and the chopped coriander to the bowl with the other veggies and then I pour the dressing over the veggies and toss them in the dressing just to coat it all really nicely there really is some serious crunch going on in this salad and that's what I like about it the most and the dressing complements it really well adding some Umami some nuttiness as well as some nice brightness and acidity to serve I like to transfer it to a sharing dish and I really should get myself a bigger one but I spread it out across an oval dish and then I like to layer in the tofu in little stacks you could of course Also Serve All the separate components family style so everyone can add what they want to their plate but I think this looks really beautiful and here I'm just sprinkling over that sliced spring onion and some more coriander leaves and then finishing off the salad with some chopped mixed and salted nuts the almost Final Touch is of course the quick pickled chilies that have now been sitting in that pickling Brine and becoming really nice and mellow and you can add as many or as few as you like to suit your level of spiciness then to wrap it all up I like to sprinkle it with some toasted sesame seeds for a little extra Crunch and beauty so that is my crunchy cabbage salad and this salad really is great in so many different scenarios since it's mainly made from hearty veg you can meal prep it for your lunch boxes it will keep well in the fridge for a few days but it is also equally great to make for lunch when you have friends and family over it's in a nice colorful bright and flavorful dish to treat people too and it's great in Winter as it uses those inexpensive winter veg as the base but it's equally delicious in the summer when it's really hot out and you want something fresh and crunchy so basically what I'm saying is that I think this salad has it all and I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as we do and yeah thank you all very much for watching I look forward to seeing in the next video and until then take care bye", "length": 3178}

day three of the business builder challenge where i give you non-stop actual technical information on how to start your own location independent high margin high income low work alpha 2.0 business in this video i'm going to give you another clip from a business course that i did a little while ago on residual income can you make residual income through an altitudinal business yes but not the way you might think some income is 100 residual some of it is 0 residual but there's other income that\n(00:31) is kind of a percentage maybe 70 percent residual 50 residual and the more income you can create that is partially residual the less you have to work to maintain your lifestyle it's pretty nice take it away myself [Music] okay now we're going to talk about something awesome this is awesome are you ready are you ready for awesomeness i'm ready residual income what does residual income mean well that means money that comes in without you having to work for it so an example would be you have an investment in some kind of\n(01:11) stock or bond or mutual fund or etf and you sit on your ass and you get money every month you have to work really i mean you got to watch it maybe but that's it residual income now there's a lot of confusion about what residual income is in terms of business everyone understands investment income like if you buy a house you pay it off and you sit on your butt and you have a renter who rents it and pays you money every month because it's a paid off house people get that there's a lot of confusion about\n(01:35) residual income when it comes to businesses for example i'll get guys who come to me and say wow you sell ebooks that's residual income you just write a book and you put it online and you sit back the rest of your life and you get free money you have to do any work is that true the answer is yes and no so in terms of business residual income is not a yes or no binary one or zero thing it's a percentage you can have a business that has a percentage residual for example you can have a business where you\n(02:09) do some work but not a lot of work maybe you put in 10 hours a month and it pays you a hunk of money every month that's a lot of money that is a partially residual business not a hundred percent because you got to put in those 10 hours okay so it's partially residual not 100 100 residual would be you buy a bond you buy a bond and the bond pays you a dividend or percentage every year or every month and you do literally no work that's a hundred percent residual zero percent residual would be a corporate job typical job so you have a\n(02:39) job you have to go in and work at your job if you don't go in and work you don't get paid and you get zero money so that is a zero percent residual income source would be your job makes sense so between 100 and 0 you have a range so using again my examples and again this is just an example i'm going to use my examples in terms of the three businesses that i have of what percentage residual they are okay we'll go through each one pretty simple so in terms of computer consulting computer consulting i don't do that anymore you\n(03:07) did a long time ago business consulting what how residual is it if i am performing consulting services so if i'm going into a company and doing work and then they pay me is it residual no it's not residual at all right right right okay at all so this is essentially zero percent residuals but that zero percent now you could argue that maybe it's zero to five actually let's do that let's do zero to five percent you could make the argument and some people in the consulting industry have done this and i don't disagree that you\n(03:41) could charge a retainer which by the way i do for a lot of my clients you could charge a monthly retainer it's a flat fee and many months you don't need to work at all work very little and you'll still get that retainer attorneys do it too so you could argue that maybe it's five percent residual in that maybe you could charge them some money and in a given month they might not call you they could they could at any time and you have to respond or else you'll lose the income so it's still not residual but\n(04:04) you could argue okay zero to five percent residual now why would i do this why would i build this business if it was such a low residual well this is another topic i'm not going to get into in this course about business models in terms of model a model b and model c not going to go into that today but the bottom line to this is consulting is one of the advantages of consulting is that you can make very high income very quickly so i went from pretty much zero when i was 24 years old to a six figure income by the time i was\n(04:34) 27 three years doing consulting because consulting is a very high margin service and we'll talk about that in the next section i can charge a lot of money for my services i don't need a college degree i don't need a special license i don't need to hire employees i don't have any expenses so all the stuff goes into my pocket so consulting is one example of a very zero to the money business that's the good news about this the bad news is that it's not residual if i don't consult i\n(05:02) don't get paid so you're doing a trade-off in some cases depending on the business that you start now is this alpha 2.0 compatible or not doesn't matter residual aspects of your business are completely up to you whether or not you want them or not totally up to you it can be alpha this is alpha 2.\n(05:18) 0 income because i can do this location dependent anywhere in the world i want so it still is compatible with this model it's just not residual but the plus side is i make a lot of money or i can't make sense cool cool now let's go over to black dragon my bd business how much residual factors does this have well let's talk about that for a minute so i sell ebooks the guy who says hey it's ebooks or residual income you write the book and then you sell it you sit back and you get money is he right yes he's partially right\n(05:46) here's a question let's say and i went through all the income streams i had in the bd business in a prior lesson okay let's say starting tomorrow morning i decided to retire now i will never retire i love to work i'll back off my work hours but i will never retire working is awesome i love working working is one of my greatest joys and i have strong goals and strong mistakes so i'm never gonna retire but let's say i got hit in the head with a truck and i woke up and i was a different person i said okay i'm done\n(06:13) i'm not gonna do any more work i'm just gonna go to the bahamas and sit in a hut and watch porn and do that for the rest of my life and do nothing else and i'm not gonna work i'm not gonna check email i'm not gonna write blog posts i'm not gonna make social media posts i'm not gonna talk to my audience if someone calls me i'm gonna ignore it let's say i did that okay in the bd business which generates a lot of money per month it's a very profitable strong business would my\n(06:38) income go from that point to zero would it do that immediately as soon as i went to the bahamas no it would keep going matter of fact the next month i'd probably make the same amount of money and maybe the following month i'd make the same amount of money but would that income maintain if i was completely off the internet vanished off the face of the earth no at some point that income would start sloping downward eventually now it may never go to zero it might go from a very big number to a much smaller number and that smaller\n(07:04) number would maintain in perpetuity so that's residual income in that respect but the income i currently make would not maintain if i wasn't around okay it wouldn't so that is a partially residual business how long would it take for me to do no work for the money to go from here down to here i don't know for sure i've made some estimates my estimate is about two to three years so it would go down every month for two to three years and finally it would level out of this much lower figure but for\n(07:31) the next two or three years i could rely on some residual income so my best guesstimate based on my what i have and the numbers i've got in my business and things like that and my business experience is that this would be 70 residual it's not a hundred percent it's about 70 percent which is good that's good and it's a good deal of money so it's okay but i can't rely on this for the rest of my life if i choose not to work i still have to be in front of my customers in front of my audience\n(07:57) on a regular basis doing blog posts publishing new products um being available to check email respond email questions things i have to kind of be around now you could argue i have to be around as much as i am that's true but again i'm trying to scale my business like i talked about last time okay so it's 70 residual not bad pretty good pretty good as compared to zero percent now again the question why wouldn't you do that over that because unlike this business this took a longer time to get to the money as i talked about i didn't\n(08:25) market this business at all in terms of spending money i did it i did it all based on blog posts and forum posts and things like that so it took me a year or two to get to the income point that i wanted where i was happy whereas this i made money really fast so that's a general mathematical formula you can rely upon the more residual a business is the longer it will tend to be to get to the income okay whereas the faster you get the income the less residual it tends to be there are a lot of exceptions that rule but that's\n(08:54) generally an accurate rule okay and this is a perfect example of this it took longer to get to the money here but a lot more residual it was very fast to get the money here not residual at all cool cool okay so the third business ccm this is very special this is my special business so ccm is where and i will go into detail about this in a future lesson don't worry ccm is where i market to the dead accounts of a given computer consulting company and then for two years i get 50 of the gross income of any business they receive off that\n(09:28) marketing so i work for about six weeks in terms of direct mail telemarketing things like that i do a big marketing blitz and then i sit back and i get a big check every month for two years i'm gonna go into detail about that if you're freaking out don't worry don't worry we'll get to it now the other beauty of this is that that work involved 95 of that work is outsourced i only do five percent of that work i only have to do a few things to make sure that business operates everything else is outsourced to other humans so i\n(09:56) do very little work and once i do the work i have to do zero work for the next two years to retain that income and to get new clients also takes very little work so this business is 95 residual 95 or close to it maybe you could argue 90 but damn near 95 if not more is residual i only have to do about five percent of work in that business to get to the money pretty awesome and again the question well why wouldn't i do this because it takes time to ramp up that kind of business because i have to develop marketing systems that\n(10:30) i know for a fact work and i'll go into more detail as we talk about this business so as you can see and i didn't do this on purpose i just did this by accident i have a pretty good spread i'm pretty diversified i have a high income low residual business i have a high income high residual business and i have a ridiculously residual business i have all three i've covered all the bases it's very likely in the next year two two three years i may even stop doing this and focus on these two which will\n(10:56) drop down to two companies but that's fine two is okay because these are so attractive with their residual models which means i resi relied on this income for a while until i hit these two which is fine and you may decide to do that maybe over time once you have three companies or four companies or two companies you may decide that one isn't really working for you anymore you delete that one you focus on either two or other three that's fine so again as you're designing your business which we're going to talk about in the next\n(11:19) section as you're designing your business from the ground up you want to give some thought to how much residual factor do you want to have for your income sources very important in terms of long-term goals in your life okay does that make sense it makes sense pretty cool okay that wraps it up for this section next section we're going to talk about how to actually start your business i'm going to go through all that stuff in detail i'll see you in a minute bye",

{"prompt": "Title: \"Sony FX30 - The Nostalgic Film Look (My Color Grading Workflow) - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"so I've been taking the fx30 with me everywhere to test out its fullest potential I've taken it to Korea Taiwan and Mexico to capture memories and also used it on Commercial work as well and surprisingly this camera can do 99 of what the fx3 can do at least from a use case you get better low light on the fx3 but other than that the fx30 still competes pretty hard with the fx3 the potential coming out of this camera is just amazing for its price so today I want to share how I color grade and how you can make the footage look beautiful coming from the fx30 [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign happy 2023 to everyone my name is Victor and today we're going to go through how I color grade my fx30 footage and first we're going to go through all the settings and that is the h265 format internally which is the xavc HS the reason why I use the HS format is because one it is a mix of Both Worlds of the S and the s i meaning that it is compressed and also it gives you a better quality image in terms of the recording format from your camera now one of the biggest requirements for this is to have an editing machine that has an h.265 accelerator that means it's a media encoder and decoder so that it really processes it fast on your editing machine and specifically what I use is an M1 Pro base model 16 inch MacBook Pro and I have a 16 gig RAM and that's all that I need if you don't have a machine that has a media accelerator for h.264 or h.265 I suggest using the SI format because it's going to give you the most uncompressed footage from your camera but that means that it's going to give you larger file size but it also is easier on your editing machine because your machine doesn't need to always decode and encode the files while you're editing now let's talk about exposure for the fx30 and the fx3 I use cine EI mode on EI 400 on the base ISO 800 90 of the time night time and daytime I usually leave it at zero on the metering so that I have a good range on the shadows and also a good range on the highlights now if you're using an a74 or something that doesn't have a cine EI shooting mode or if you just want to use flexible ISO mode that's just sticking to the base isos of your camera on slog3 and for my cameras the fx30 and the a74 that is 800 base ISO and then for the fx30 2500 it is the second base ISO and for the a74 is 3200 second base ISO just going to give you a better dynamic range doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to get rid of all the noise but it would have the cleanest image from both of those base isos and in terms of metering I usually just expose it from 0 to plus one and then I get similar results with the cine EI mode that's everything you need to know before you get into color grading really nailing the settings and the exposure first before you push your color grade is a big must okay let's start off with footage from Mexico this is the Cenote scene it's going to look like this in the beginning you don't have anything we're going to turn off the effects and we're gonna do the clip here so that we have more real estate for the video okay so I'm gonna apply my VL workflow right here so that my node structures are here and node structure is similar to the layer structure it's just a little different than layers I like the nose structure better but if you're editing in Premiere Pro or Final Cut you might have to work with layers and kind of understand just how you arrange everything so this is the bottom and this is all the way to the top okay on here let's start with the CSD I'm gonna use my own personal Lut which is the film Lut you don't need to use my Luts you can use CSD in here let me guys show you the freeway of utilizing this one you go CST and then we're gonna look for Sony s-log S gamut three dot cine and then the s-log 3 and then what we're going to do is output color space as Rec 709 and same thing with this one Rec 709 and we're just going to turn this on perfect and this is kind of like how you would normally do it and if you've shot everything on s stock 3 you can actually just disable this or delete that node and go to Project settings and once you go to Project settings you go to input lookup table and then we're gonna find s-log 3 S gamma 3. cine2lc minus 709 and it's pretty much going to be the same thing and it's just going to apply it to all of your footage instead of you manually doing it on every footage so since I've developed my own Luts I'm going to use it because I love using my Luts I developed it for my style and that we're going to use it all throughout in this tutorial and you also have the free version or whatever conversion Luts that you want to use in your videos so let's get started this is the my conversion Lut and I'm just going to add maybe two points of green that's a little bit too much so I'm gonna go with 26 and a touch because in the Cenote what happened is that there's a lot of greens reflecting through these Mossy rocks and the trees as well so the skin tones is gonna get affected on that and we're gonna isolate that a little bit later okay so first things first we're gonna balance the image meaning that we want to really neutralize the colors and make sure that it's neutral as possible so that we can really push the looks so in this case I don't really have any reference in terms of whites or blacks what we can do is kind of just neutralize the blacks and maybe the whites on here so it's not having any color cast on the neutral tones so we know we're balanced what we're going to do is we're going to neutralize the whites on my hair and the blacks on my hair because this is the only reference point that I have right click and then you're gonna go show picker RGB value and we're just gonna go to qualifier so you can see the value before I'm just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we're just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we're almost all even so I'm just gonna leave it at that again we don't have a card here this is a travel video so we're just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tools that we have in DaVinci okay so now I'm gonna try and see if I'm missing anything on the white values you can see the value before I'm just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we're just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we're almost all even so I'm just gonna leave it at that again we don't have a card here this is a travel video so we're just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tool Vector scope we can see that it's almost at the skin tone line the reason why I'm leaving it first because I want to see how it looks later my skin tone is a little bit reddish and it falls under this line it's not directly on this line because it's going to get us somewhere like uh if we touch this it's gonna give me like really reddish skin tones and that's not my skin tone my skin tone is a little just under it now I want to adjust the exposure for this one so let's go back to waveform so what it does is that it just sucks out a little bit of the color with the little neutral tones and that we're bringing everything back uh that's too much and that we're bringing everything back so what happens here is that the color boost really just decreases the value of the saturation on each level in in numerical form and then saturation we're increasing that by 15 it's more like a multiplier and as you can see here the blacks and the neutral tones are a little bit more neutral and that it's a little bit more even especially for my light a little bit if you can see here the Cenote has really nice God Rays coming in and with this one is a little flat so we're going to shape that in post with a vignette and we're gonna create a new power window and we're just gonna kind of create a god Ray focusing on the subject and then we're gonna hit invert and we're just going to squeeze this down a little bit and you see how exaggerated it is so what we're going to do is a little bit darker kind of like this and then we're gonna soften it the print and then we're gonna do Kodak two three A3 enable that and it's a little bit weird right now that's why we started with the PFE adjust we're gonna try to find the Black Point we're gonna enable this where it looks natural and then the white Point as well where it looks natural you can see that it adds a lot of contrast so we're gonna try and reduce that tonal contrast and then the target white is the white balance that you started with so we had a little warmer tone so we're add a little bit of blue in the shadows um perfect and then some green cast to it awesome and then from the PFE adjust what happens if you do the print film emulation the Kodak 2383 we can increase the saturation because it sucks it out perfect that's good so now without the PFE it looks like this it looks normal but with the PFE is a little more stylized now the problem with this one is the skin tones it's too orange we're gonna go back to the skin node and what we're gonna do is go back to Vector scope you can see that it's a clean white we're gonna add [Music] I'm gonna do the radius maybe grow no we're gonna shrink it and then we're just gonna keep blurring it so that the edges are softer and then the noise for sure what I do is that we're just gonna magic mask everything but now it's gonna follow the subject great okay now now what we can do here is that bringing everything back and that looks perfect now I can see that it's just right below the skin tone line and if we push it to the skin tone line I just become more bit so uh what we can do is that we're gonna copy this and then create a new node and then this is going to be halation and then paste it there we're gonna enable the bloom and then we're gonna enable the halation on this one so that the bloom affects all the entirety of the image and then this is just Asian and what we're going to do is we're going to create a mask to the subject right here and then soft right there invert so everything gets halation but my skin tones and then we're gonna track it as well and we're done this is our look right here okay so next up we're gonna match this to the other Cenote footage we're gonna do is grab a still right here and then we just drag this we're gonna disable the skin and also delete the power grade for the halation this is a little bit too much on the halation so what we're gonna do is we are just gonna bring it down a tad and then I do want the bloom to be a little bit dreamier so we're just going to really push that so the trees is a little bit something I'm just showing you guys how I step by step do this and we are going to go to Hue versus uh U versus saturation and we're gonna get that red color and we're just going to increase the saturation so it bumps up so it pops a little bit more because without it it's looking a little dull and with it now we have some leading lines and contrasting to the blue and the green as well okay so now what we can do is grab this still because we're going to do the same thing with this shot and as you can see shots now we're gonna move on to the nighttime shots in Taiwan and let me show you guys how to quickly grade this and we're just gonna go on to my power grade again via workflow and this is quite easy so let's go to CST what we're going to do is we're going to do add the film let and then add the green tint to it perfect now as you can see that the highlights and the Shadows are a little bit crushed so we're going to go to the adjust we're going to ignore everything else we're going to quickly grade this couldn't retain anything for those lights so since it's low light we do want it to be dark but the Shadows are now crushed we're going to lift it up just a tiny bit so that we get a little bit more footage on there and then and then now we can add a little bit more green and then we're gonna go to the look which we're gonna add some blue tones to it or some green tones to the Shadows teal or green doesn't matter and then the gamma to a little cooler tone to the blue side that's a little too much actually because I love that profile and then we're gonna reset the sharpen to just adjust and then what we're gonna do is enable PFE kodak2383 print film and we're just going to adjust the colors and then from me here on we're just going to adjust the white balance to maybe a cooler tone and now this is kind of a true orange and teal look low light footage and we're just going to adjust the highlights again and the Shadows so that we retain the information with here because before we had the information on there but with did something to the highlights we're gonna adjust it again a little bit lower perfect and then maybe a darker Vibe with everything last but not least the film grain I love film grain and that we're gonna add this Shadows all under 30. and we're done this is the final look and then we're just going to copy everything again to the other footage right here this is actually almost done just gotta lift up the blacks a little bit and this is the final look as you can see the computer can't handle the answer orange and teal or kind of just green Subway look into this video uh it's a little saturated in my taste and her skin tone is actually closer to Yellow and what we're gonna do is gonna go use saturation give it just a negative value on there and then there you go we're looking at a super green cast and then apply the skin adjustment we're looking at normal skin tones again with a little green cast to it so I find it looks good what it is and then we're just gonna do the same here we're gonna change the adjust because you learned something new and that if you do have any questions about anything that we went through today feel free to comment down below and we're bringing it back I'm giving away my slot 3 Lut pack

{"prompt": "summarize, in outline: \nextract notable quotes:\n- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.\n[energetic music] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are going to talk all about dopamine and what drives you to do the things that you do.\nWe're going to talk about motivation and desire and craving, but also how dopamine relates to satisfaction\nand our feelings of wellbeing. And of course, any discussion about dopamine has to include a discussion about the potential\nfor dopamine induced addiction. Indeed, dopamine lies at the heart of addiction\nto all things. But today we are mainly going to focus on, how what we do and how we do it,\nand how we conceptualize those things leads to changes in this amazing molecule\nin our brain and bodies that we call dopamine. I'm going to teach you what dopamine is and what it is not.\nThere are a lot of myths about the molecule dopamine. We often hear about so-called dopamine hits. Today, we are going to dispel many common myths\nabout dopamine, and we are going to talk about how dopamine actually works. We're going to discuss the biology of dopamine,\nthe psychology. We will discuss some neural circuits and a really exciting aspect of dopamine biology\nor so-called dopamine schedules. In other words, we are going to discuss how things like food, drugs, caffeine, pornography,\neven some plant-based compounds can change our baseline levels of dopamine and in doing so,\nthey change how much dopamine we are capable of experiencing from what could be very satisfying events,\nor events that make us feel not so good because of things that we did or took prior.\nSo I promise you it's going to be a vast discussion, but I will structure it for you,\nand you'll come away with a deep understanding of really what drives you. You will also come away with a lot of tools,\nhow to leverage dopamine so that you can sustain energy, drive and motivation for the things\nthat are important to you over long periods of time. Before we dive into the meat of today's discussion,\nI'd like to share with you a fascinating result that really underscores what dopamine\nis capable of in our brains and bodies, and underscores the fact that just through behaviors,\nno drugs, nothing of that sort, just through behaviors, we can achieve terrifically high increases in dopamine\nthat are very long and sustained in ways that serve us. This is a result that was published\nin the European Journal of Physiology. I'll go into it in more detail later, but essentially what it involved is having human subjects\nget into water of different temperatures. So it was warm water, moderately cool water and cold, cold water.\nHad them stay in that water for up to an hour, and they measured by way of blood draw\nthings like cortisol, norepinephrine and dopamine.\nWhat was fascinating is that cold water exposure led to very rapid increases in norepinephrine\nand epinephrine, which is also just called adrenaline. It also led to increases in dopamine.\nAnd these increases in dopamine were very significant. They kicked in around 10 or 15 minutes after submersion\ninto the cold water. And I should mention the head wasn't below water is just up to the neck. And the dopamine release continued to rise\nand rise and rise, and eventually reached 250% above baseline. Now, what was interesting is after subjects got out\nof this cold water, that dopamine increase was sustained. And I know nowadays many people are interested\nin using cold water therapy as a way to increase metabolism and fat loss,\nbut also to improve sense of well-being, improve cognition, improve clarity of mind.\nThere's something really special about this very alert, but calm state of mind that seems to be the one that's optimal\nfor pretty much everything except sleep, but for all aspects of work and for social engagement\nand for sport that highly alert, but calm state of mind really is the sweet spot\nthat I believe most of us would like to achieve. And this cold water exposure done correctly\nreally can help people achieve that state of mind through these increases in dopamine that lasts a very long time.\nSo I will later detail the specifics of that study, what it entailed in terms of how long,\nthe variations, the different subjects experienced, as well as how to limit the amount of stress hormone,\ncortisol, that's released as a consequence of the cold water. And we will also talk about compounds, supplements\nthat people can take in order to increase their levels of dopamine should they choose. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that the visual system has to go through a lot of work in order to main clarity of what you see\nwhen there are shadows, when you go into different types of indoor lighting, and so on. And a lot of glasses don't work well\nbecause you put them on, and then you're in bright light and you can see fine, but then you move into a shadow and then you have to take them off and they don't adjust,\nor they don't adjust quickly enough. With Roka their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed with the visual system biology in mind.\nSo you always see things with perfect clarity. The glasses are also terrific because they're very lightweight, and they won't slip off your face if you're exercising,\nif you're running or biking. In fact, they were designed for the purpose of being able to be worn while you're engaging\nin those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk. I happen to wear readers at night or when I drive or when I work,\nand I love their sunglasses cause I can wear them anywhere. And also the aesthetics of their sunglasses and eyeglasses\nare terrific. Unlike a lot of other performance glasses that frankly make people look like cyborgs. The aesthetics on Roka's are really terrific.\nYou could wear them anywhere you'd like to go.

Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals. I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done. And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also analyze your DNA to see what you ought to be doing for your immediate and long-term health.\nWe hear a lot these days about optimization, optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism, optimizing this, optimizing that,\nbut unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors, hormones and other things that are in your blood and DNA,\nyou don't know what to optimize. With InsideTracker it makes all of that very easy. They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test,\nor you can go to a nearby clinic. They send you the information and you take those results. And unlike a lot of laboratories doing blood work out there\nand DNA tests, they have a simple platform, a dashboard that walks you through your results\nand helps you identify what sorts of nutritional or behavioral or other types of practices you might want to incorporate into your life\nin order to positively impact your immediate and long-term health. It's a very easy system to use,\nand you will gain a ton of information simply by doing that test.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies and has over 600,005 star reviews.\nI've been meditating for a long time, but I confess sometimes I meditate and sometimes I'm very inconsistent about my meditation.\nIdeally, I would meditate every day for 20 or 30 minutes, but what I found over the years is that,\nI'll start a meditation practice and then as life gets more stressful or busier,\nwhich is exactly when I need to meditate more, I tend to meditate less often. Switching over to Headspace as a meditation app\nreally helped me stay consistent with my meditation practice. And that's because they have a huge range of meditations\nto select from. Some are short, some are longer. And in general, I try and get 20 minutes of meditation\nin every day, but some days it's just five minutes and they have some terrific just five minute meditations. The science says that even a five minute meditation\ncan be beneficial for different aspects of our brain and body. If you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to www.headspace.com/specialoffer. And if you do that, you'll get one month as a free trial\nwith full library of meditations that you can use in any situation.\nThis is the best deal offered by Headspace right now. So if you're interested, go to www.headspace.com/specialoffer\nto get one free one month trial with Headspace's full library of meditations.\nI'd like to announce that there's an event that some of you may find very useful. This is an event put on by Logitech\nthat I will be speaking at. It's called Rethink Education, the Biology of Learning Reimagining Learning\nthrough Neuroscience. And at this event, I will be speaking, there will be other speakers as well, and I will be talking about neuroplasticity\nand its applications for teaching and for learning. I will describe what I call the plasticity super protocol\nthat incorporates all of what we know about rapid learning, efficient learning and the best ways to teach and learn.\nIt's geared towards educators of all kinds. It is zero cost. So please feel free to sign up.\nThe event is September 30th, 2021 at 3:00 p.m Eastern.\nYou can find the registration link in the caption for this episode. So let's talk about dopamine.\nMost people have heard of dopamine, and we hear all the time now about dopamine hits. But actually there's no such thing as a dopamine hit.\nAnd actually the way that your body uses dopamine is to have a baseline level of dopamine.\nMeaning an amount of dopamine that's circulating in your brain and body all the time. And that turns out to be important for how you feel\ngenerally, whether or not you're in a good mood, motivated, et cetera. And you also can experience peaks in dopamine\nabove baseline. Now, this has a very specific name in the neurobiology literature,\nso-called tonic and phasic release of dopamine. And I'll explain what that means in a couple of minutes.\nBut if you remember nothing else from this episode, please remember this, that when you experience something or you crave something\nreally desirable, really exciting to you, very pleasurable. What happens afterwards is your baseline level\nof dopamine drops. Okay? So these peaks in dopamine, they influence how much dopamine\nwill generally be circulating afterward. And you might think, oh, a big peak in dopamine after that,\nI'm going to feel even better because I just had this great event. Not the case. What actually happens is that your baseline level\nof dopamine drops. And I will explain the precise mechanism for that. Okay?\nIn the neuroscience literature, we refer to this as tonic and phasic release of dopamine.\nTonic being the low level baseline that's always there circulating,\nreleased into your brain all the time. And then phasic these peaks that ride above that baseline.\nAnd those two things interact. And this is really important. I'm going to teach you the underlying neurobiology,\nbut even if you have no background in biology, I promise to make it all clear. I'll explain the terms and what they mean.\nAnd I'm excited to teach you about dopamine, because dopamine has everything to do with how you feel\nright now as you're listening to this, it has everything to do with how you will feel an hour from now,\nhas everything to do with your level of motivation and your level of desire, and your willingness to push through effort.\nIf ever you've interacted with somebody who just doesn't seem to have any drive they've given up,\nor if you've interacted with somebody who seems to have endless drive and energy, what you are looking at there in those two circumstances\nis without question a difference in the level of dopamine circulating in their system.\nThere will be other factors too, but the level of dopamine is the primary determinant\nof how motivated we are, how excited we are, how outward facing we are and how willing we are,\nto lean into life and pursue things. Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.", "length": 3355}
{"prompt": "Audio transcript part 1. Please provide an executive summary of the conversation so far:\n\nAllergist 0:00 \nI'm here to talk about your son. Yeah, my\n\nTom 0:02 \nson, Thomas, he is almost seven years old. And he has. He's basically struggled with severe allergy to dairy his whole life. And, you know, other allergies that we went to. They basically told us there wasn't anything I could do. And then, you know, I did some more research and discovered, you know, there's these kind of like new new therapies to help desensitize. You know, I mean, like, he's had to go to the emergency room like, five times in his life, due to EpiPen incidents with dairy. And it's pretty terrifying as a as a parent, you know, and also kind of frustrating, the more allergists aren't doing anything about this. So, yeah, I'm really excited to find out that y'all might be able to help us. And I'm kind of hoping to talk to him more about it.\n\nAllergist 1:04 \nAbsolutely. I just have a few more questions for you just kind of about his history really quick. So when did you guys first discover his allergy to milk or dairy in general?\n\nTom 1:18 \nSo it was when he was still an infant? Yeah. We, we had you know, we had been my partner. She'd been breastfeeding him, you know, and but we tried to give him Formula One day, and he threw up, we didn't realize that it would throw he threw up from allergies. And we just like, oh, he doesn't like the formula, we'll find something else. And, but then repeated incidents where we gave him other formula, he would always throw up and he'd have and then we noticed other things like he was getting, you know, kind of like red faced and whatnot. And then we realized, and he'd always cry, you get all sniffily, he started getting, you know, he would get all runny? Because no, that's when we realized, Oh, he's had an allergic reaction. We ran to the emergency room with them, you know? And, yeah, so. Yeah. Did that answer the question?\n\nAllergist 2:18 \nYes. Yes. Yeah. So alright, so any young age when you guys kind of were weaning him? Yeah, breast milk and into formulas when this all started? Okay. Good to know. Um, and then. It sounds like the first several instances was really only vomiting and then it kind of progressed to obviously anaphylactic type reactions.\n\nTom 2:41 \nYeah, yeah. And he also is allergic as it turns out to dogs. So we had when he was born, we had a dog in our house. And he always I mean, he always was sniffily always had these, you know, he was always kind of runny nose and everything. And, you know, we didn't figure out that he was allergic to the dog until he was, I think, like one and a half or so. But his reaction, I mean, he was okay. He was sort of, okay, around the dog. But then we, we had, so once we discovered he was allergic to dog, we rehome the dog. And then he wasn't around a dog for you know, like a year or so. And then when he was around a dog, he suddenly had like this big reaction, you know, like broken out and like hives and whatnot. So, he went from being barely allergic to dogs to being pretty highly allergic to dogs, due to I guess, lack of exposure to the dogs anymore. So it's two big allergies are our dairy and dogs, but especially the dairy he's had actual anaphylactic responses to dairy. And there's been instances where like, he was at daycare, and they gave him a stick of cheese and he ate the whole thing. And then they're like, oh, no, he's having we're like, did you not do not know how many times we told y'all he's allergic to dairy? How do you make cheese? It's when they're like, yeah, it's especially like, you know, you ask them, Are they they say just dare. Does butter have dairy in it?\n\nAllergist 4:18 \nIf you're wondering, just err on the side. Oh, man. Yeah, it sounds like they've been kind of a source of many of his reactions.\n\nTom 4:29 \nYeah. Yeah. Okay, he's had he's had, he's had a dairy incident at literally every school and daycare he's ever been in. And it's like, it's all day. There's always some incident where he had he, somebody gives him something he shouldn't have. Although he is now old enough to read the labels himself, and you know, he now knows, you know, don't accept anything unless you know, for sure it's dairy free. But yeah, it was A scary back then. Yeah, it's\n\nAllergist 5:03 \nso unfortunate because they should be looking out for him because he's too little and envy, you know, sees everybody else is having a cupcake or something like, yeah, sorry for little kids to be like, Oh, I shouldn't eat this.\n\nTom 5:15 \nYeah, like, yeah, one time he picked up the glass of milk from the kid next to him and just chugged it, you know, didn't realize it was his cup, you know? Yeah.\n\nAllergist 5:26 \nWell, I'm glad that he's kind of a little bit older now. How long has it been since you guys have kind of done any sort of like allergy tests, whether it's a skin test or bloodwork?\n\nTom 5:36 \nSo in, in background in Arizona, he had a full panel prick test, as well as a bunch of at least have some I don't even I can't remember what like how many different things he was tested for. On the blood test, or the prick test. But it seems like a lot of allergist want to do prick tests, and instead of blood test, and then I had some I had another doctor tell me he said, If the allergist only wants to do prick test, and they don't do blood test, run away from him. That's what he said. He said, allergists that only do PARCC tests are just trying to milk as much money on the insurance companies as they can. That's what this other doctor told me. But my partner, she firmly believes in prick tests, and she doesn't. She doesn't necessarily prescribe to that same view. So whatever. But so we we do both. Yeah, I like the idea of both. I like the idea of bonus. So\n\nAllergist 6:35 \nskin tests tend to be a little bit more, I don't wanna say this, like revealing of you know, how how significant the allergy may be how someone may react. But at the same time, we just we feel like it's a good idea to to get both because sometimes you'll test just one and maybe it shows up as a very low level. And if you test the other one, it might be high. And so it just gives us a better picture. Obviously, his history tells us that he has anaphylaxis to this. So we already kind of can gauge the severity. But where kind of both come into play a lot more in our office with the treatment that we do is, over time, we will repeat those results so that we can monitor the trends and eventually, hopefully see those numbers trends downward. How long do you think it's been since his his test in Arizona? Was that like last year?\n\nTom 7:32 \nSo he was allergy tested with the prick test in like the last month that at? Like multi care our I don't know, there's a met, there's an allergist place out in Lakewood that we took him to recently. They they actually were the ones who mentioned you all when I asked when I pressed the issue. So that's kind of how I found out about y'all.\n\nAllergist 8:02 \nYeah, great. So what I'll maybe do after we're done talking, I will send you a form, it's a release of information or request form, you complete it and send it back to us. That'll give us permission to fax it to multicast or whoever did this yen test. And we can we can obtain those records. So we at least know his if his per test was a month ago, we don't need to redo it, we typically will only redo it if if it's more than a year out. If it's more than a year, we want a more updated result. But so that way we can request their records and just have have at least a baseline for him on file.\n\nTom 8:44 \nSure. Yeah, we can definitely do that. No problem. I suppose I thought we'd already released it. But okay, I'll do. I'm not sure I might not have made that form didn't have that.\n\nAllergist 8:58 \nYeah, I just don't see anything, at least in his chart. From what I can see all always double check. But what is kind of, we just need your permission to reach out to them and request those records without your permission. They obviously won't give them to us.\n\nTom 9:13 \nYeah, let me see here. I think it's allergy. It's\n\nasthma and allergy specialty services. at Lakewood. I don't know what you need for me for that release thing or whatever. But\n\nAllergist 9:33 \nyeah, so I'll send you I'll send you the form and then you just fill it out and sign it and send it back to us. Okay. Okay. And then we'll we'll fax them and request the they fax us the\n\nTom 9:43 \nresults. Okay, yeah, no problem. And then, you\n\nAllergist 9:47 \nknow, obviously, it'll be great to see where those results live, but because we do have a couple of forms of treatment, but based on the severity of his allergy, the treatment that Thomas would As a kind of a candidate for something called oral immunotherapy, or oh, it for short, okay. And so kind of what oh, it looks like is we bring you into clinic for an appointment, they are extended appointments, so you're scheduled for like three or so hours, doesn't mean you're going to be in clinic that long, but they are scheduled as long appointments. And what we do is we just start with a very small diluted dose of whatever the person's allergen is. And we have them consume that dose, we then will wait 20 minutes and monitor. After the 20 minute mark, we come back in repeat vitals, assess the patient, make sure there's no signs of allergic reaction. And then if everything looks like it's being well tolerated, we give a second dose. And we'll repeat that with the goal of being four doses per appointment. Whatever dose we get to in clinic, is the dose that we would send you guys home on. Okay, and you guys wouldn't give that to Thomas once a day, every day until you return to clinic to increase more. And so we kind of do this cycle until we get to our desired like goal dose. And then we call it our maintenance dose, once he gets to that maintenance dose, we then have him stay on that dose once a day, every day for three years at home. And we just kind of check in periodically, you know, one month after he reaches maintenance, then another three or six and then yearly if things are really going well. Typically, once a year will repeat bloodwork just to monitor the trends. And then at about the three year mark will repeat the skin test and the bloodwork and basically what we're looking for is an 80 to 90% reduction in his numbers to kind of signify a long term tolerance. And then at that point, we can always discuss, you know, decreasing the number of times in a week that he has to consume his dose with the ultimate goal, hopefully being, you know, just twice a week minimum to maintain any tolerance that we've built and continue to expose his body to the food. So that's kind of a general overview of how it works. Obviously, if there's any sort of adverse reaction in clinic, like let's say he gets a dose and he gets really sniffily, like force breaks out in some hives or something, obviously, we stop up dosing, we're not going to keep pushing at that point. We have all sorts of antihistamines, as well as epinephrine and those kinds of emergency meds on hand to treat any reaction that happens in clinic. And we would obviously send you guys home on a lower well tolerated dose, and then proceed up dosing. You know, the next visit some people we have to go a little bit more slowly than others. And we might not always do for up doses in an appointment. Okay. Do you have any questions kind of about the process?\n\nTom 13:24 \nNo, I mean, that that all lines up with my already existing understanding of how it all worked, although it's nice to have more specifics I am also interested in so he is he's currently taking their tech every night and has been for years, basically. And I'm concerned about that, because their tech has these like liberal warnings and other things. And I don't know, I just it, it also like it's like at a certain point like, is it even doing anything anymore? But then when we take him off of it, then he gets all sniffly. And it's like, well, what if we could just get him off of allergy meds daily allergy meds to his like seasonal allergies and his dog allergies? Like, are there shots or other treatments he could be doing as well, in addition to the dairy to solve those other allergies to Can we can we attack the whole front and just fix his allergies, that's what I'd really love to do.\n\nAllergist 14:17 \nSo, um, so you had mentioned the dog, you know that he gets runny nose, you know, hives, the whole kind of Gambit. So it sounds like he also has some environmental allergy symptoms as well. Yeah. similar symptoms with like runny nose, nasal congestion, those kind of\n\nTom 14:37 \nYeah, the vast majority of his symptoms exhibit as sinus post nasal drip, basically almost all of it. It's basically everything he does. 90% of times it results in sniffling and coughing. Okay. Yeah. Okay.\n\nAllergist 14:52 \nSo taking Zyrtec every day, is he doing any like no sprays or anything like that?\n\nTom 14:58 \nHe's doing Desertec eat has half a pill absurd tech he hasn't been doing any nose sprays.\n\nAllergist 15:05 \nOkay, so never tried like a over the counter phonies or anything like that.", "length": 3667}

He doesn't like things going up his nose, but also also just kind of like being worried about the long term effects of that like I used to do that myself different sprays and it ended up screwing up all my sinuses and all this like, I solved a bunch of my sinus problems by just doing saline rinses. And I haven't had a cold in like five years. Because every time I start to feel anything, I go do my Arm and Hammer nasal rants and I spray into everything out and then I reboot my sinuses doesn't work. Clean it out. Yeah. And then I go get a gold, I don't know, I have avoided COVID I've already cold I have nothing. I haven't had anything in like five years ever since ever since doing saline rinses. But and before that I had years and years of sinus infections and everything while trying to manage them with flow neighs and all these different things. So I guess you could say that I have maybe a little bit of a bias against no sprays. And maybe I'm being unfair in that regard. But maybe that's why we didn't really pursue it a whole lot.\n\nAllergist 16:28 \nYeah, I mean, and you're also right, like little kids don't typically make it easy if you're trying to spray anything on their nose. So that can sometimes be just more of a battle. But then it's worse. So I understand that. But from kind of a treatment standpoint, with kind of Thomas's age, we do have two forms of treatment available. One is kind of your standard allergy shots. And so that basically starts out with, you know, weekly injections in the back of the arm, starting at like a super small, diluted dose and building all the way up to maintenance. We, we typically do weekly injections, if you come in once a week, every week, it's about 45 weeks of weekly injections before people get up to maintenance. And then at that point, we transition to monthly injections. And you're on the monthly injections once a month for about three to five years. So it is kind of a commitment just because environmental allergies do do take quite a bit of time for the body to become less sensitive to those allergens and produce a long term tolerance that that would last rather than sometimes if you've come off of allergy shots too soon, people with symptoms will will return. And you won't get much, much time as far as symptoms, you know, staying away. Yeah. So kind of the standard,\n\nTom 18:05 \nI can definitely say that. He hates shots. And it might very well be that we just have to do the nose spray thing because I'm pretty sure I can get them to tolerate no spray is more than getting to tolerate weekly shots.\n\nAllergist 18:21 \nYes. The other caveat is we have something called sublingual immunotherapy or select for short. And this, this treatment is a lot of times targeted towards kids who are less than five years old or who can't tolerate shots. And so basically, we're still looking at like a three year timeframe. But instead of shots, what we do is we administer the dose as a drop under the tongue. And so you come into clinic, it's four appointments, each appointment is about an hour long, we administer the dose under the tongue and wait an hour just to make sure it's really well tolerated. Before we send you guys on your way. At home, you would do one one drop every day, or five to seven days before increasing to two for the same time period three, and four. Once you guys got to four drops, you just hold there until you come back to clinic to increase to the next concentration. So we do that about four times. And then once you get to four drops at the highest concentration, you just hold there once a day every day for three years. Repeat skin test at the three year mark, kind of looking for the same thing decreased by about 90% to signify that we've desensitize the body to those allergies and then at that point, you can come off of this lip drops.\n\nTom 19:52 \nOkay. Is there a way to combine that with the dairy\n\nAllergist 19:57 \nlike in the same appointment or Yeah, so you're asking? We typically don't We don't do that because if there is an adverse reaction, we want to know what to so we can address it appropriately as to which one we need to decrease. So typically, we like to do one thing at a time.\n\nTom 20:18 \nOkay, what about what about when he they have multiple allergens to multiple like dogs and cats, you literally have to do a session for each one. So if you don't have to do a session for each for dogs and cats, why would you have to do a separate session for dairy? Why not combine dogs, cats and dairy?\n\nAllergist 20:37 \nUm, well, so it's no different than like allergy shots. environmental allergies can be combined to like when someone comes in for an allergy shot, and they have pollen allergies, you know, there are tons of pollen allergies, and if you if you gave someone a shot for each one, someone might be getting like 50 some shots. Yeah. Yeah, so for environmental is we can group them all in the same vial. There's, I mean, there's only so much space, but we can group a ton of them in the same vial until we run out of space, essentially. But we just can't mix food and environmental\n\nTom 21:13 \naudit. Okay, so for the food when What about what if a visitor to two kinds of foods because you would you still do each food allergy separate? And then but only environmental ones can be combined? Is that as it how it works? Yeah.\n\nAllergist 21:25 \nSo it kind of depends on the foods, like certain foods we can do together. So like, if people come in and they have, you know, three or four nut allergies, we can do the oh, it to all the nuts combined. But like if we were dealing with like milk and not, because one is like, you know, a dry, crushed form one's liquid. That becomes too challenging. We can't really mix those well. Okay. So, in that sense, sometimes, yes, sometimes. No, it just depends on the person's food allergy. We're dealing with.\n\nTom 21:58 \nOkay, yeah. All right. Well, I would definitely say that the the sublingual therapy for his environmental allergies is something that I'm very interested in. Yeah. And also the, I mean, the two things, unfortunately, are your clinics up in Bellevue, I think we're down here in Tacoma. So if we're going to do this, it would involve a lot of traveling a lot of lot of times,\n\nAllergist 22:27 \nyeah, the night that's why the sublingual was also a little bit of a nicer option for environmental if you live further away, because you're not having to come to clinic, like once a week, you know, obviously, there are four visits, but then after that, you're just kind of maintaining their dose at home. Okay. So it'd be like, you know, four visits, if you, if you did it, you know, or visits roughly three to four weeks apart for a couple of months, if everything goes really smoothly. After four months, he's on that maintenance dose, and just holding, which is nice, because then he was holding there, making sure his bodies you know, getting that daily exposure at a well tolerated dose so that we can you know, teach it to be less sensitive. The Oh, it is obviously more challenging that something we're not really obviously willing to let people do at home just because, you know, we're dealing with more severe anaphylactic reactions. And we don't want to kind of have any anaphylaxis at home if we can help from it. So that's why we like to do the up dosing in clinic and more controlled environment.\n\nTom 23:34 \nThat makes sense. So if we did the dairy when how often we have to come up there.\n\nAllergist 23:45 \nSo the nice thing about it is as long as he is getting his daily dose at home, in theory as much time could elapse between appointments. So because you guys are traveling, you could always come in less frequently. I would say standard, most people come in once every two to three weeks. But we do have some people who come in once a month or you know, once every six to eight weeks and just up dose a little bit more slowly. So that's a little bit based on your guys's schedule. And obviously, the fact that you guys would be commuting from Tacoma.\n\nTom 24:22 \nOkay, what do you need to come off of the Zyrtec and allergy medicine while he was doing this?\n\nAllergist 24:29 \nNo. We, we understand that people have environmental allergies. And so if it's something that he takes daily to manage those symptoms, we don't we don't have people come off of them.\n\nTom 24:42 \nOkay, okay. I just didn't know if it might affect his body's like ability to build up immunity or something or if it would affect your testing like, gives you a false negative or something.\n\nAllergist 24:54 \nYeah, so sometimes like if people are on a dailies or kick you know, and then when They they just randomly stop, you know, it might have been suppressing the immune system enough to make the dose more tolerant, and they might have an allergic reaction. So that's one kind of consideration. But we also know we don't want people to be absolutely miserable struggling with environmental allergy symptoms in the middle of pollen season. Because that can sometimes be very miserable for them. So\n\nTom 25:25 \nI guess what I'm getting at is should we take him off of his our tech, while we're establishing the maintenance dose? Would that be a good idea?\n\nAllergist 25:33 \nYeah, I mean, it wouldn't hurt but if his environmental allergy symptoms are too too much, we, we recommend that people take their antihistamines just to prevent those symptoms. Because sometimes, like, you know, if your environmental allergy symptoms are significant, it can sometimes make it hard to distinguish Oh, is your nose runny? Because of your environmental allergies? Or are you reacting to your dose? Yeah, so it's a little bit of a catch 22 there but we just do our very best to assess and make sure that we're not missing an allergic reaction. Okay.\n\nTom 26:13 \nWell, I mean, I already know enough about this to know are already want to move forward. So what do we do from here?\n\nAllergist 26:21 \nYes, so a couple of follow up questions really quick. How long has it been since Thomas did any sort of bloodwork for his milk allergy? Just to get a baseline we wouldn't have to wait for the adults to come back before starting but okay, curious.\n\nTom 26:34 \nYeah. Um, I I can ask his mom that we can get all that sent over to you I guess. I think whatever paperwork or any of that we have there Yeah, and the release for the other allergy stuff. I don't think I think the last time we had blood work was when we were in Arizona. So I think I think that would have been like two years ago.\n\nAllergist 27:03 \nOkay, yeah, you can confirm your your partner and then if it has been you know, more than a year we can always send you guys a lab order over Clara to like a LabCorp request something that's close to you guys and Tacoma and you can just kind of get that done at your earliest convenience and then though, send us the results\n\nTom 27:22 \nYeah, I'll be honest with you I'm not super happy with his with the allergist clinic down here and I don't even know if they blood if when he was blood tested that the right things were blood tested you know for especially for this region, you know, we live in Washington it might be a good idea to do that lap and just like what what blood tests what things would you recommend that we had some test you know,\n\nAllergist 27:55 \ndefinitely interested in seeing what his overall milk value would be as well as kind of one of the most common proteins in milk is casein so we'll usually test that just to see how allergic he is to that particular protein. If you're interested we have the ability to do just a Western Washington environmental panel to look at some of the more common tree weed\n\nTom 28:20 \nyeah that's that's definitely something I'm interested in yes yeah. Yeah, so that that\n\nAllergist 28:25 \nwould be my initial like go to doesn't sound like he's avoiding any other foods or has any other issues to foods is that correct?\n\nTom 28:34 \nYeah, the only food we're aware of that he has issues with his dairy there was a period when he was younger where he their eggs were so we're sort of appearing on it but a little bit that as far as I know it's gonna He's never had an any type of noticeable allergic reaction to eggs\n\nAllergist 28:50 \ncould have been a false positive or just very mild allergen at one Yeah.\n\nTom 28:54 \nYeah. So I don't know I definitely definitely having a I mean, if we were gonna are we gonna do a Western Washington blood panel anyway, we could just do the casing while we're at it, and you just have the fresh most up to date info and we don't even have to worry about\n\nAllergist 29:13 \nleaks. My other comment would be when he was allergy tested at the place of Tacoma. Did they do any sort of environmental as well?\n\nTom 29:21 \nUm, the last time he was there, they only tested for the milk they didn't do the environmental Yeah,\n\nAllergist 29:27 \nokay. Okay. a while since he's done that\n\nTom 29:32 \nI think it's been like six months or something since they did the larger prick test where they picked him up with a bunch of different things and he had you know a bunch of marks on his on him I gotta double check find out when that was Yeah,\n\nAllergist 29:49 \nyeah, well, we can do is we do you have a preference if it's LabCorp quest?\n\nTom 29:56 \nI don't know. I guess it all depends on our insurance or I don't know if it matters.\n\nAllergist 30:04 \nmost insurances, it doesn't matter. But if you want to check with them beforehand, let us know. And then I can just send you a lab order to whatever lab you prefer.", "length": 3742}

{"prompt": "4.6 Complex Relationships\nSibling Relationships and Mutual Transit: Our algorithm does not infer sibling relationships, where the same\norganization owns multiple ASes, which can therefore have\nunconventional export policies involving each sibling\u2019s peers,\nproviders, and customers. Similarly, we do not infer mutual\ntransit relationships, where two independent organizations\nprovide transit for each other in a reciprocal arrangement.\nBoth of these arrangements can lead to paths (and triplets)\nthat violate the valley-free property, and in particular produce p2c-c2p valleys in paths. Gao\u2019s algorithm [18] inferred\nthat two ASes involved in a non-hierarchical path segment\nwere siblings, which maximizes the number of valley-free\npaths. Dimitropoulos et al. used WHOIS database dumps\nto infer siblings from ASes with similar organization names,\nbecause policy diversity among siblings makes it difficult to\ninfer siblings from BGP data [16]. Our algorithm does not\nattempt to resolve these unconventional routing policies because it is difficult to accurately classify them; as a result,\nour algorithm produces p2c-c2p valleys in paths.\nFigure 7 provides three examples of non-hierarchical path\nsegments caused by siblings (figure 7(a)), mutual transit (figure 7(b)), and route leaks or path poisoning (figure 7(c)).\nIn figure 7(a), ASes 9398 and 9822 are ASes owned by the\nsame organization, Amcom Telecommunications, which implements complex export policies with these ASes. Specifically, we observe customers of 9822 are exported to 9398\u2019s\npeers and providers, and routes originated by 9398 are exported to 9822\u2019s providers. These policies induce a p2cc2p valley in a path, because we infer 9398 is a customer\nof both 9822 (path x) and 2914, and observe 9398 to announce customers of its inferred provider 9822 to its other\ninferred provider (path y). In figure 7(b), independently operated ASes 6772 and 15576 implement mutual transit, owing to complementary traffic profiles: AS6772 is an access\nprovider with mostly inbound traffic, while AS15576 is a\ncontent provider, with mostly outbound traffic. A WHOISderived database of sibling relationships does not help infer mutual transit arrangements. Finally, route leaks and\npath poisoning can also result in a p2c-c2p valley in a path.\nFigure 7(c) provides an example of a route leak from 6203,where it provides transit to a /24 prefix announced by one of\nits providers (AS2828) to another provider (AS7922). The\nprefix AS2828 announces is a more specific prefix of a /16\nprefix that AS6203 announces, and has likely leaked because\nof a prefix list configured in AS6203. An alternative explanation is that AS6203 is poisoning that path so that AS2828\ncannot select the more specific prefix. We believe a route\nleak is the more plausible explanation because AS2828 is\nthe only AS to originate the prefix. Without the use of prefixes, it is not possible to distinguish this valley from mutual\ntransit or siblings. We do not currently use prefixes in our\ninference algorithm; detecting and validating route leaks and\npath poisoning remains an open problem.\nWe used sibling inferences derived from WHOIS database\ndumps [25] to evaluate how the sibling links in our topology\nwere classified. We did not use these sibling inferences in our\nalgorithm because (1) we did not have supporting WHOIS\ndatabases going back to 1998, (2) in validation the sibling\ninferences contained a significant number of false-positives\n(where two ASes were falsely inferred to belong to an organization), and (3) they do not help distinguish mutual transit between independent ASes from other anomalies such as\npath poisoning and route leaks. In total, there were 4537\nlinks observed between inferred siblings for April 2012; we\ninferred 4238 (93%) of these to be p2c. Because we inferred\nmost of the siblings to have p2c relationships (i.e. a transit hierarchy) we also used the sibling inferences to examine\nif the ordering of ASes in paths supported the classification. Of the 312 organizations for which we observe at least\ntwo siblings in a path, 275 (88%) had a strict ordering; i.e.\nAS x was always observed in a path before sibling AS y.\nFor example, we observed 21 Comcast sibling ASes in BGP\npaths with at least two siblings present; all of these ASes\nwere connected beneath AS7922. It is possible that Comcast\u2019s siblings exported routes received from their peers (if\nany) to other siblings. However, we did not see any peer\nlinks from beneath AS7922 (perhaps due to limited visibility), and it would make more engineering sense to share peer\nroutes among siblings by connecting the peer to AS7922.\nPartial Transit, Hybrid Relationships, and Traffic\nEngineering: Our algorithm infers either a p2p or c2p relationship for all links. A partial transit relationship typically\nrestricts the propagation (and visibility) of routes beyond a\nprovider to the provider\u2019s peers and customers. Similarly,\ncomplex import and export policies can produce hybrid relationships [27]. Figure 8 depicts an AS pair with a c2p\nrelationship in one region, and a p2p relationship elsewhere.\nBecause publicly available BGP data only includes the best\npaths announced from each AS, there is no way to distinguish hybrid relationships from traffic engineering practices\nsuch as load balancing across providers. Similarly, ASes A\nand B may enter into a p2p relationship, but B may not advertise all customers or prefixes to A, requiring A to reach\nthose via a provider. We consider hybrid relationships and\ntraffic engineering when computing the customer cone of\neach AS, which we describe in section 5. Modeling routing\npolicies remains an open problem [27].\nThe presence of hybrid relationships can cause our algorithm to incorrectly infer a c2p link as a p2p link. In figure 8,\nif we observe no providers of A announcing routes to E via\nA then our algorithm infers the c2p link between A and E as\np2p. This inference occurs because step 10 collapses triplets\nwith no relationships inferred for either link; i.e., it does not\nadjust the triplet \u201cE ? A > B\u201d. A separate step is necessary\nto distinguish partial transit relationships visible from a VP\nbelow the provider from peering relationships.\nPaid Peering: An assumption behind c2p and p2p relationships is that the customer pays the provider and p2p\nrelationships are settlement-free, as historically p2p relationships were viewed as mutually beneficial. Modern business\nrelationships in the Internet are more complicated; ASes\nmay enter into a paid-peering arrangement where an AS\npays settlements for access to customer routes only. Multiple\nnetwork operators confirmed several aspects of paid-peering:\n(1) approximately half of the ASes in the clique (figure 5)\nwere paid-peers of at least one other AS in the clique as of\nJune 2012; (2) paid-peering occurs between ASes at lowerlevels of the AS topology; and (3) routes from paying and\nsettlement-free peers have the same route preference. This\nlast condition prevents us from distinguishing paid-peering\nfrom settlement-free peering using BGP data alone.\nBackup Transit: A backup transit relationship occurs\nwhen a customer\u2019s export policies prevent their routes from\nbeing exported outside a provider\u2019s customer networks. The\nexport policies used while the provider is in backup configuration are identical to peering; the difference between\nbackup transit and paid peering is due to export filters instead of a contractual agreement. Our algorithm infers most\nbackup transit relationships as peering.\n4.7 Validation\nIn this section we evaluate the positive predictive value\n(PPV) and true positive rate (TPR, or recall) of our heuristics against our validation dataset (section 3.6). Our AS\nrelationships dataset consists of 126,082 links; we validated\n43,613 (34.6%) of these. Table 2 shows the PPV of inferences made at each step of our algorithm. Most relationship\ninferences are made in steps 5 (56.4%) and 11 (37.7%), and\nboth of these stages have excellent PPV (99.8% and 98.7%).\nTable 3 compares the PPV of our inferences and those\nmade by four other popular inference algorithms for April\n2012 BGP paths. Our algorithm correctly infers 99.6% of\nc2p relationships and 98.7% of p2p relationships. We asked\nthe authors of SARK [34], CSP [27], and ND-ToR [33] for\nthe source code for their algorithm, or for a set of relationships inferred from April 2012 BGP paths; we did not receive\neither. Gao\u2019s PPV for p2p relationships is the highest of the\nalgorithms tested because it makes the fewest number of p2p\ninferences of all the algorithms, inferring many more c2p relationships than exist in the graph. The algorithm that per-forms closest to ours is UCLA\u2019s; our improvements result in\nsix times fewer false peering inferences. We assembled additional historical validation datasets by extracting relationships from archives of the RIPE WHOIS database (RPSL,\nsection 3.4) and public BGP repositories (BGP communities, section 3.5) at six month intervals between February\n2006 and April 2012. The validation performance of Gao,\nUCLA, and CAIDA algorithms are quantitatively similar as\nshown in table 3.\nWe investigated the types of errors that these four algorithms produce, focusing on the two cases with significant\noccurrence: where we correctly infer c2p (p2p), but another\nalgorithm mistakenly infers p2p (c2p). We note that when\nthe ground truth is p2p, Gao often infers the link as c2p,\nusually with the customer having a smaller degree than the\nprovider. On the other hand, UCLA and Isolario produce\nerrors where a p2p link is inferred to be c2p, often with\nthe customer having a larger degree than the provider. The\nUCLA algorithm often infers c2p links to be p2p because it\nuses the visibility of a link from tier-1 VPs to draw inferences, and defaults to a p2p inference for links it cannot see\n(see section 2). We agree with the intuition behind this visibility heuristic and use a variant of it in our algorithm, but\nwe use additional heuristics to accommodate for phenomena that inhibit visibility through tier-1 VPs, e.g., traffic\nengineering, selective announcements.\nWe compared our inferences with 82 partial transit relationships that were flagged by a community string. Our\nalgorithm correctly inferred 69 (84%) of them as p2c; 66 p2c\ninferences where made in step 10. In comparison, UCLA\u2019s\ndataset identified only 13 (16%) of the partial transit relationships as p2c. We also compared our inferences against\na small set of 27 backup p2c relationships, of which only 2\nwere correctly identified as p2c. Validation data for partial\nand backup transit relationships is scarce because of their\nrarity and their limited visibility.\nIt is well-known that the public view misses a large number of peering links [6]. While our algorithm can only make\ninferences for links we observe, an important question is\nwhether its accuracy is affected by a lack of (or increasing) visibility. We performed the following experiment 10\ntimes. We start with paths selected from a random set of\n25% of VPs, and successively add VPs to obtain topologies\nseen from 50%, 75% and all VPs. We measure the PPV\nof our inferences on each topology subset. We found that\nthe PPV of c2p inferences was consistently between 99.4%\nand 99.7% on all topology subsets. We found that the PPV\nof p2p links varied between 94.6% and 97.7% with 25% of\nVPs, and 97.2% and 98.4% with 50% of VPs, indicating that\nour algorithm performs better when it has more data (VPs)\navailable. Consequently, if our visibility of the AS topology\nincreases in the future (e.g., due to new VPs at IXPs), the\naccuracy of our algorithm at inferring the newly visible links\nshould not be affected.\nWe agree that collecting validation data is difficult and\ntime-consuming [9, 16, 18, 34] because the relationships are\nconsidered confidential and often covered by a non-disclosure\nagreements, but we gathered validation data from multiple sources that represent more than a third of the publicly\navailable graph. The previous most validated work was Dimitropoulos et al. [16], which validated 9.7% of inferences", "length": 3273}

When a student is not looking for a permanent stay or a year-plus lease & usually, they are moving to a new city where they do not know much about the zone.\nSolution Summary\nNEST provides a service to both, local landlords situated near the universities to prospect short- term rentals for their properties which aren \u0301t providing them any income and usually end up costing them. Students from all over the world are looking for an adequate place to live during their education with the right roommates for an appropriate rate. Through a compatibility test that will run a thorough matching from a sum of profile points, covering everything, from their budget and location to a match percentage for both landlords and current roommates of the property.\nMarket\nOur market consists mainly of young men & women which are mostly foreigner students looking for a room to rent, for a 3\u20136-month period, close to their college, we are talking about male and female only or co-ed apartments and houses occupied by students from 17 to 27 years old. Currently in Mexico City, one out of nine students are foreigners, looking for a place to rent, and the only one`s renting the rooms are independent landlords or mayor student residentials. That is why we attack two markets: the students which are at a high demand and landlords that have their properties on the leasing market, stocked and costing them negative cash flow on their maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses that come with owning real estate.\nUniversities in the city have housing programs where they need to locate their foreign students and also rent full houses at a high market value and accommodate their students.\n4\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

Our biggest competitor on the market now is roomiesmexico.com, which we \u0301ll use as a marketplace as well, just like all our competitors to begin our traction and generating massive leads.\nMarket Competitors:\n- https://roomiemexico.com/\n- https://en-mx.roomlala.com/\n- https://www.iroommates.com/\n- https://roomiapp.com/\n- https://www.roomgo.com.mx/ -\nWhy Us?\nNest provides more than just a space to live or a marketplace for roommates and students to find each other for a temporary home, it provides proven compatibility match between: Landlords, Students & Roommates.\nWe \u0301ll revolutionize the industry by making the whole experience more personal between the roommates that will end up living together. With a quick 3-minute test they will get a customized service that will help them accommodate better in their new home. As for the landlords, our software shall provide a friendly user experience for our management service and transaction management.\nExpectations Forecast Mexico City\nOur \u201cgoing to market\u201d strategy consists of a pre-campaign starting in December 5th for early showings to measure the demand and prepare for the high demand season in January. We \u0301ll attack the market by advertising our rooms on all the marketplaces, from Google \u0301s SEO to Facebook \u0301s Marketplaces, plus all the property searchers or IDX \u0301s, like our competitor \u0301s, while simultaneously bringing all leads to our platform to perform our compatibility test.\n5\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

The investigations or \u201ccompatibility test\u201d, per room-rate shall not surpass the 6 to 1 ratio.\nThe second source of income is the lease or listing commission fee to the landlords that we \u0301ll assist occupy their vacant property and rent it for a higher rate than the one they would \u0301ve gotten at the regular lease market. On the first phase of the project, we \u0301ll charge 50% of a month \u0301s rent per room, naturally to the landlord.\nThe third source of income is the management fee, a 15% management fee from each month \u0301s rent per room to the landlord that acquire this optional but preferred service to help control the variables of the tenants/students.\nFinancial Highlights by Month Mexico City\n9 Room Projection:\n Room #\nRent/Month Rent Fee (50%) Admin Fee Test Fee/Room (15%)\n Gross income/Room\nRoom 1\n$ 5,000.00\n$ 2,500.00\n$ 750.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 2,500.00\nRoom 2\n$ 5,500.00\n$ 2,750.00\n$ 825.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 2,750.00\nRoom 3\n$ 6,000.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 900.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,000.00\nRoom 4\n$ 6,500.00\n$ 3,250.00\n$ 975.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,250.00\nRoom 5\n$ 7,000.00\n$ 3,500.00\n$1,050.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,500.00\n Room 6\n$ 5,500.00\n$ 2,750.00\n$ 825.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 2,750.00\nRoom 7\n$ 6,000.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 900.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,000.00\n Room 8\n$ 6,500.00\n$ 3,250.00\n$ 975.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 3,250.00\nRoom 9\n$ 7,000.00\n$ 3,500.00\n$1,050.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,500.00\n TOTAL\n$ 55,000.00\n$ 27,500.00\n$ 8,250.00\n$ 27,000.00\n $ 27,500.00\n 6\n CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

Even after you find a suitable place to live, close to your school and public transportation, perfect location, you must deal with your roommates. It is not easy to live with someone that you know, now imagine someone you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a big factor for anyone looking for a minimum 3 month stay.\nThe growth of the student market has created a very high demand of short-term rentals, there a various modalities: Family rents a room to a student, student housing, student co-living buildings, roomies rent out rooms and subletting.

Co-living was inspired to create a unique and high-quality student living concept in India by a combined experience in the student housing market in India and overseas. The potential lines in the gap in India\u2019s student housing industry in terms of quality infrastructure and personalized services. In India, the student housing business generates more than $15 billion in revenue yearly and is predicted to rise by multiples. The segment receives a demand from approximately 11 million migrant students on average. Hence, there is a strong need for a professionally managed, tech-enabled student living experience, and that consumers are eager to try out a new value proposition.\nColiving is a new type of housing in which inhabitants share a living space and a common set of interests, values, and goals. It\u2019s a fresh perspective for the millennial age, emphasising openness, collaboration, social networking, and the sharing economy. Nowadays, students prefer co-living accommodations since it provides them with a greater sense of independence. Being away from parents, moving to a new city, and adjusting to life away from home are hard tasks. Students must have the confidence to make their judgments when moving away from home and settling in a new location. Fully furnished rooms, cleaning and maintenance services, utilities, furniture, and other amenities are all included in co-living accommodations. Currently, the real estate business is concentrating its efforts on Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Jaipur, and other educational hotspots.\nCo-living, which is sometimes referred to as \u201can extension of dorm life,\u201d allows renters to rent a private bedroom within a bigger apartment. All co-residents share living rooms, kitchens, and other common areas. Cleaning services, pet care, and cooking tips are frequently included in the package. Co-living differs from room sharing in that a tenant has an individual lease rather than a shared lease and is thus only responsible for their bedroom and bathroom. Co-living is an excellent alternative to an oversupplied luxury multi-family market from the standpoint of landlords and developers. Young renters with disposable income can benefit from co-living situations.\nSWOTS\n9\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE. This business plan contains confidential, trade-secret information and is shared only with the understanding that you will not share its contents or ideas with third parties without the express written consent of the plan author.\n \nNEST STUDENT CO-LIVING\nMillennials and other renters are looking for new technologies as they hunt for new ways to rent. Co-living is a fantastic illustration of this because it is a technology-driven service that gives tenants and landlords more options.\nSimilarly, solutions such as lease guarantee or security deposit replacement are allowing millennials to move when and how they choose. Anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of business and economics understands that the sharing economy is the way of the future. The sharing economy is where supply meets demand. It all started when the internet changed the way people communicated. The Internet leveled the playing field and encouraged businesses to digitize their data. The way we gain information and communicate has altered because of search engines and social media.", "length": 3624}

So that's why we didn't say let's piggyback on that, and see how we continue to manage the kind of relations that we've built over the past couple of years. And then I think I will then jump into the introductions. I think what I will do, I will I will allow our colleagues from Sal to introduce themselves and then I'm then hand it over to you guys to then introduce yourself, I think on my side, I'm steering towards the symposium responsible for the contract will be a comment and I will then allow Hannah and Amanda visitor to record introduce themselves.\n\nUnknown 0:46\nOkay, good morning, once again, I'm sure you know me very well. And I'm from the data analytics division in South and we on a frequent basis with a similar theme pertaining to data and data set that helps you navigate around Thank you Good morning, everybody. My name is Robin today's\n\nUnknown 1:16\nprocurement working together with Mr. cosi I'll be assisting him on the contract. Thank you\n\nMthokosi 1:32\nYeah, I think you can you can be able to come to a menu, introduce yourself to the to your colleagues.\n\nMarina Short 1:43\nOkay, thank you. So for those of you that don't know me, my name is Marina short and proud CEO of consumer profile Bureau, and always refer to us as a proudly female, managed and pod owned credit bureau so very proud to be a partner to such and being able to make a difference in our beautiful country\n\nbrian jean 2:09\nare short on the Key Account Manager for the source account. So basically, everything runs through me on the middleman to make everything work.\n\nUnknown 2:23\nAlright, good morning, everyone. Good to see you again. Online. My name is Toby satsa. I'm heading up the News New Business Development Center. Great meeting everyone met Anna and welcome Robins first time learning material and other colleagues think you\n\nMthokosi 2:49\nknow, thanks a lot colleagues would think it means we have covered some part of the agenda, which is the introduction part and I think I've got a number of apologies from the colleagues from business coming close also from finance but the quality also from procurement because this last two weeks of the end of financial aid and pathetic but I thought we quality cannot postpone the meeting because we've noted this SRM for quite some time now. And I thought it's important that at least we will start the discussions and then we can be able to have a follow up meeting sometime next month I think which is what we've agreed on. To say the follow up meeting will be in the office well we'll also be able to see some of the things that you pious you for you've managed to put in place for over a couple of years. Having came through from the position where you are and to a position where now we are considered as one of the main player within the space and I think we just something that is very commendable. Yeah, no, I think and then another thing what I what I indicated was on the latest discussions to say they are going to put it here so that we can be able to make impulse to eat before we can be able to dive into it. So I will I will allow the team from cpp to then be able to submit their input before we can discuss the items that have been proposed.\n\nMarina Short 4:33\nI don't think we've got anything else on the agenda other than what you brought up like at nos also alluded to earlier. I think Erina as discussion she said twice a month but I think it's more like twice a week. At this stage and we've managed to our sink bolt a very good relationship and we deal with items as and when they occur. So I don't think anything else that I want to add to their agenda.\n\nMthokosi 5:00\nI think why not? Why not? Why don't we do our DCP bid team to to be able to give us an overview of the of the contract that is there any changes or any development that is m two. I think that they have a the items that CPP was our was appointed for in terms of how is the contract to the relation so far. Is there any one or two things I'm concerned so in other things that we should take note of such that we can be able to see as to how best we can assist you to amaze you the ambition is to go because the only 90 situations where we've seen the newspapers that are indicating that the relationship is not in a good space between Samsung and CPP Yeah.\n\nMarina Short 5:55\nYeah. Thank you. I think I'm Eugene. I don't know if you can maybe as you got the usage list. Maybe just me can actually share the records that has been utilized to date. I think that is the type of inquiries that has been accessed into our environment, maybe just a confirmation on I think the compliance processes. So with regards to the source contract and tender all the inquiries at the back end in our environment or footprint it but it's most so none of the inquiries will ever show on any front end credit report. It is not impacting anybody's credit score, and there's very limited access into that data set. So what Eugene is currently showing is the aggregated anonymized inquiries that has been done, which is in the report, but the detail around to access it for what purposes is available to site if they want to utilize that for any other purpose. But on our side, that data is actually hidden. And only people with specific axes can can see that so maybe just as a as an entry point. I think if we look at the inquiries that has been done, we see that there's quite a few inquiries that was done around business interest around screening, trusts people with trust and we see deeds and property ownership. We also see quite a bit of confirmations of records of deceased and the Home Affairs data and actually added to the other data sets that we have. So I think there's been also trace inquiries which we've seen a growth in into the trace inquiries, which means that you know, understanding the profile of a person is income, his assets and his liabilities, but also the contact ability to make sure that the person can be identified. So we've seen that increased and also good utility of things like the like I said, like the trust data. I think those are the standard inquiries, and those are balanced back into the billing reports. That is balanced back once again into the invoices and statements. We just on that I think we've also got the ad hoc projects which from time to time they do engage with us and the current project we're quite excited about is the one that we are actually assisting search to identify whether the the footprint is actually representative of way the consumers or the entities are. And we went to market with something that is our new to market on the individuals and we newly registered companies were actually done. And we've had some iterations we have also had some challenges around the data that sits in the address data. But things I've done quite a bit of work. We've had the team over December, worked extensively, to get the extracts done as quickly as possible. And we're very excited that as a side project from that project that was done if I remember correctly, Eugenia and add an ACC and maybe helped me but I think it was 110,000 consumers that was created active that we actually identified or a flag which is such that is currently not registered on the search database and I think that's the value add and exciting things that we want to be involved in not just the inquiries. So I think in a nutshell, that is that is the usage and the inquiries, I don't know, you know, I don't know. There's anything that are left out but you know, very excited that we also did. I think maybe just another point, as part of the value adds that we presented in our tender there was quite a few initiatives which we recommend it should be considered by such under the adult projects. And one of them was the income estimator way. estimating what a person's income is based on what he's spending in the market is actually a very good high risk flag indicator for SAS if that is compared to income that is actually declared. So I think that was one of the projects and I know it is currently under consideration. And I think another one which under the value s which I do think it's something in the future that could be a value is to bring the credit report in on the actual e filing. We believe that if people see that such can see what they spending and what the actual credit is that there will be more transparency and honesty on the actual declarations that is happening. So we've got quite a few value add projects but and we are continuously engaging with the team on that.\n\nMthokosi 11:27\nThanks a lot with that. I think in the main my interest will be that as part of your continuous discussions and engagement with our business stakeholders at mind the team member you need to start to discuss the value add proposition that was submitted with the be discharged and they can see as to what are the things or things that you guys you can be able to do beside what you're currently doing which is what you are currently touching based on because there are a number of ways in which we can still be able to increase the they take space which is the space that you guys are playing with him I think why do I still get this question what I wanted to check is to say do you guys also provide consumer behavior kind of projects, you know, we were able to tap into how does this certain group of consumer behaves which can then assist us to be able to know as to what is the best way to engage them to be able to get demand because a consumer behaves differently. So so so I think that's the question that I had around\n\nMarina Short 12:54\nhere definitely. in custody, I think what we've got is our artificial intelligence and machine learning. Division is something that I think the only thing we basically started touching on with value, as we already discussed, was actually the income estimator. And the income estimator for us was quite a good indicator of you know, what are people spending and, and, and the behavior. So we did another project for for the National Credit regulator. We we found 100,000 consumers, that is under debt review, but that's actually deceased. That is still being flagged as under debt review me we find in municipalities people that are indigent that owns property of over a million Rand and the behavior I think that that you referring to is absolutely something which I think when we have a bit of a workshop with a team with such is, you know, what are we trying to understand, do we want to target new to market consumers make sure that, you know, how do we engage with them? Where do they operate? How do we get them included in the base? Absolutely a project we would love to do. We have strengthened our artificial intelligence and machine learning departments and we are taking awesome things to market like possibility to lapse and a possibility to default and, you know, possibility to upsell for some of the clients and we are seeing things like flapping cycles consumers starting to miss payments of certain types of of the obligations and what we read from the these these very interesting things around. What we currently looking at is the CPI unemployment. What is happening with fuel levies, what is happening was the different stages of electricity and where people spending the money and where they're having trouble. And we would love to, you know, utilize those insights more effectively to help such to be able to fulfill their, their obligation to the country, but we're very excited to see how well so she's doing really it's, it's for us, we've got a lot of doom and gloom in the country and I think we are in a difficult phase or political environment, but I always try and focus on how can I make a difference how can I I cannot help the country and that's what we want to do. And I think that I think between Erina and Eugene, I think they've I really want to recommend the relationships I've managed to build or hardly ever have to step in. But sometimes it helps to just, you know, get me or hobby, so involved and then we can get the team and the office to run straight again. But I think we've built a very good relationship. And I'm actually very proud of the team and how well they're working together.\n\nUnknown 16:10\nYes I would just like to add to it Marina, just to give me two quizzes in like a practical example.

And like now even now in this week, as we are discussing it, they went the extra mile because we've realized that there are some lead side quality checks pertaining to that South African post office data that needs to be done and in squat and hybrid pause to do these quality checks because the soap information is not accurate. And there are like, let's say inconsistencies. But as we are speaking that busy with this quality assurance to do reruns based on the clean up and to provide us with even more clean up data. And in this week, we'll have a follow up meeting to discuss the outcome of this data set from my side. I just want to say and thank you for your professional way of doing things. It's comforting to us because we need to make informed decisions based on the title we're saving from you and you really, really go out of your way to ensure that it's the best quality given It is your source\n\nThis transcript was generated by https://otter.ai\n\nGet Outlook for Android", "length": 3315}

{"prompt": "Getting Started\nThese Docs are a Genius App\n\nInteractively explore API endpoints by connecting your Genius account to this page. Learn how your app can access Genius's content and community this easily too!\nAdd Genius Annotations To Your Own Site\n\nIn addition to interacting with Genius annotations through the API, it's easy to make any page annotatable and display annotations you've created on it. Just add the script tag:\n\nRegistering Your Application\nFirst, visit the Genius API Client management page and create an API client for your application. This will provide you with a client\\_id and a client\\_secret that you'll use to identify your application to Genius. The redirect\\_uri is used for authenticating Genius users with your application. You can change it later. The API Client will belong to the user account signed in to Genius when it's created.\n\nMaking Requests\nThe available endpoints are listed below in the resources section, along with embedded examples showing how they work and what they return.\n\nGenius uses OAuth2 for authentication. All API requests must be authenticated. There are plenty of libraries available to help with this part of your integration. There's also a detailed guide below if you're committed to implementing it yourself.\n\nResources\nAnnotations\nAn annotation is a piece of content about a part of a document. The document may be a song (hosted on Genius) or a web page (hosted anywhere). The part of a document that an annotation is attached to is called a referent.\n\nAnnotation data returned from the API includes both the substance of the annotation and the necessary information for displaying it in its original context.\n\napi.genius.com/\nannotations/10225840\n Authorization: Bearer\nAccess Token\nSee details about using an access token in the authentication section below.\n \nGET /annotations/:id\nData for a specific annotation.\n\nid ID of the annotation\n10225840\ntext\\_format Format for text bodies related to the document. One or more of dom, plain, and html, separated by commas (defaults to dom). See details of each option here\nText Format\nPOST /annotations\nRequires scope: create\\_annotation\n\nCreates a new annotation on a public web page. The returned value will be the new annotation object, in the same form as would be returned by GET /annotation/:id with the new annotation's ID.\n\nExample Payload:\n{\n \"annotation\": {\n \"body\": {\n \"markdown\": \"hello \\*\\*world!\\*\\*\"\n }\n },\n \"referent\": {\n \"raw\\_annotatable\\_url\": \"http://seejohncode.com/2014/01/27/vim-commands-piping/\",\n \"fragment\": \"execute commands\",\n \"context\\_for\\_display\": {\n \"before\\_html\": \"You may know that you can \",\n \"after\\_html\": \" from inside of vim, with a vim command:\"\n }\n },\n \"web\\_page\": {\n \"canonical\\_url\": null,\n \"og\\_url\": null,\n \"title\": \"Secret of Mana\"\n }\n}\nannotation\nshow child params\nreferent\nshow child params\nweb\\_page\nAt least one required\nshow child params\nPUT /annotations/:id\nRequires scope: manage\\_annotation\n\nUpdates an annotation created by the authenticated user.

Each referent is associated with a web page or a song and may have one or more annotations. Referents can be searched by the document they are attached to or by the user that created them.\n\nWhen a new annotation is created either a referent is created with it or that annotation is attached to an existing referent.\n\napi.genius.com/\nreferents?web\\_page\\_id=10347\n Authorization: Bearer\nAccess Token\nSee details about using an access token in the authentication section below.\n \nGET /referents\nReferents by content item or user responsible for an included annotation.\n\nYou may pass only one of song\\_id and web\\_page\\_id, not both.\n\ncreated\\_by\\_id ID of a user to get referents for\nUser ID\nsong\\_id ID of a song to get referents for\nSong ID\nweb\\_page\\_id ID of a web page to get referents for\n10347\ntext\\_format Format for text bodies related to the document.

{"prompt": "Please improve and expand this essay and include more quotations and sources: Jane Eyre (Argument) In \u201cJane Eyre\u201d we are introduced to a girl that is faced with a lot of challenges. These challenges influence her in many ways to her decisions that she has made throughout the novel. Going from facing her parent\u2019s death and growing up as an orphan who is raised by a cruel aunt, to growing up learning how to raise herself and find happiness through rough times. Even dealing with the decision of possibly having to let go of the man she is in love with because of his dishonesty. Most of all she is challenged in choosing what is more important to her to stay independent or to kill her loneliness with a man that she is in love with named Rochester, with the risks of him being a false appearance to what she met him as. The difference between loneliness and independence for Jane is loneliness is her feeling of emotions that helps her achieve independence which is providing for herself, and creating stability to seek happiness. Jane is being raised at a place called Gateshead by the Reed\u2019s, a very wealthy family. She is sent there by her kind uncle Reed after her parents die from a disease called typhus. While she is there she is mistreated by her cruel aunt Reed. When a fight breaks out between a cousin and her she is punished for throwing a book at his face and is blamed for the cause of it. Her aunt places her in a room referred to as the \u201cred room\u201d where her uncle dies, and while she is in there she believes that she sees his ghostly spirit and it frightens her into a shock and she passes out. This sets Jane off and she is facing a problem with feeling that she is singled out in the family and wants to neglect them because of her mistreating. Although there are some people who are nicer to her that work in Gateshead, her aunt gives her a title of being a liar from all the false statements that Jane makes to them. I believe that she is feeling this way because she has lost respect for her aunt Reed and really wants to neglect her. Jane says \u201cI am glad that you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you 2 when I am grown up; and if anyone asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\u201d (95) Mrs. Reed\u2019s reaction was shocking, but Jane was entitled to her own opinion and that is how she felt about her aunt that promised to take good care of her when her parents were dying. Jane\u2019s actions show that she wants to leave and she already has her mind made up that she is going to leave but doesn\u2019t know when. This is the set off to Jane and her structuring life to growing up being independent. Jane is struck with news that she will be sent off to school to a place called Lowood. She meets a seemingly nice principal named Mr. Brocklehurst before attending and she thinks that this is going to be the beginning of a possible happy life until she arrives and sees otherwise. Jane quickly meets a girl that she becomes really close with at Lowood that sticks with her through humiliation that she goes through at school named Helen. When Helen lets her know that the school she is at is a school for charity maintained for female orphans, you can imagine the thoughts that were going through her head that she was not wanted at Gateshead. She is a young girl that just feels alone in the world that she lives in. This influenced her to grow up being independent as well, with the guidance of her strong faith in God and her religion to keep her going. She uses her faith as guidance to where she will continue her life and move forward to what she feels God wants her to do. While she was at school the Reed\u2019s sent a message with the Principal that Jane was a compulsive liar and that she was pretty much unmoral. Jane realizes that she is at a really strict school and when a event happened that Jane was accused for Mr. Brocklehurst put Jane on a pedal stool and told everyone that she was a liar and to not associate with her. Though Helen stuck with her and attempted to lift her spirits telling her that most of the girls felt pittier for her than looking at her as guilt Jane still feels alone. 3 When Helen soon dies from consumption Jane is further more upset than anything and feels that it is not meant for her to have anyone close in her life. Jane quotes to herself \u201cI remembered descending that hill at twilight: an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood; and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had no communication by letter or message with the outer world.\u201d(151) Jane is reminiscing her past and this is symbolizing her loneliness, she is further more believing that it is meant for her to be alone in the world that she is living in and that her independence was created from this. The difference of her feeling alone is to fulfill her happiness and her independence is to assure herself that she can still make it without depending on anyone. She grows in to a woman that wants to have her own stableness. What\u2019s bizarre about this quality of Jane is that she lives in a era that women do not work to have their own stableness unless they inherit it. Women were known to depend on their husband to take care of them and their families. Later Jane grows up and moves away from Lowood to a place called Thornfield where she is starting her life and tutors a girl named Adele. While she is there, she is introduced to a man named Rochester who is uncharacteristic when he first meets her, but eventually pulls the attention out of Jane with his strong personality. Jane eventually finds herself attracted and falling for Rochester after saving his life from a fire. \u201cAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.\u201d(220) she is showing that her feelings for Rochester is there and even though she may have seen some faults in him the actual attention she had from him made her feel wanted. Something that she has 4 not felt in a long time, the fact that it was an event that caught her off guard she refuses to let her guard down immediately but she will cherish the moments she gets from his attention. The feeling of being lonely has started to fade and she realizes that the attention she gets from him makes her feel happy. \u201cBut I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and former faults of morality had their source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged.\u201d(220) I believe that this is faith in Jane\u2019s personality, and the past that she came from where people who has mistreated her had never gave her the time or belief that they had a better side of them. Rochester with some faults still has a better side and can still cheer her up with just associating makes him potentially tolerant to Jane. Jane has the ability to consider Rochester\u2019s faults because she mentions when talking to herself that she would be willing to satisfy his grief, whenever he might be moody she has the heart of a teddy bear. \u201cI cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.\u201d (220) Why would someone who has never been treated good by someone she loved be willing to fix what she does not necessarily like? Jane\u2019s feign for happiness is followed by her obsession of attention and satisfying from the absent of loneliness which Rochester shows her these qualities. Meanwhile as Jane is asked to join a party that is filled with elegant and aristocratic guest. Blanche Ingram and her mother are ahead of the party members and they treat Jane with distain and cruelty, Jane does not take this well and leaves in tears before she is stopped by Rochester who catches her down emotions. He lets her leave because she is upset but he tells her that he wants her to come by the drawing room every evening during his guests company at Thornfield. \u201c Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening: it is 5 my wish; don\u2019t neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adele. Goodnight my ---\u201c He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.\u201d (259) I believe Jane catches on to this as she might have enjoyed this ever more than she speaks right away. Jane knows that Rochester is showing affection and cares about her and to see her on a everyday occasion. This is the affection that makes Jane feel less lonely and makes her happy inside. Jane desperately travels back to Gateshead when she hears her aunt Reed is dying, while she is there she is presented with a old letter and news that she has family that wants to adopt her and share with her some of their wealth, that she later gets in the novel. She is away for a couple of months and gets news that Rochester had went to buy a new carriage, something intended for a marriage. Jane\u2019s feelings for Rochester are addressed more by the narrator when she returns back to Thornfield. She shocks herself when she expresses to Rochester how she missed him while they were away from each other. \u201cThank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad to get back to you; and wherever you are is my home, my home only home.\u201d (330) This is an example of Jane\u2019s happiness from the presence of Rochester. She feels that she is no longer lonely when it comes to people she is encountered with. Although her independence still takes place when she has taken it upon herself to travel to Gateshead alone and see her aunt Reed that dies. Jane\u2019s faith in God fortunately guides her to finding out that she has family that she eventually inherits wealth from. Post acceptance to Rochester\u2019s proposal she contacts her uncle John Eyre and lets him know of her wedding. John makes Jane his heir and she is now equal footing to Rochester. This makes Jane more comfortable to marrying Rochester, and satisfies her doubts that the wedding possibly will not happen. \u201cDo you remember what you said of Celine Varens? Of the diamonds, the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Celine Varens. I shall continue to act as Adele\u2019s governess: by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty 6 pounds a year besides. I\u2019ll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but.\u201d (356) Jane\u2019s independence is shown here when she expresses to Rochester that she will not marry him until she is able to have her own stability. She uses a lady that Rochester had encounters with in the past that he nourished, and she explicitly says that she will not be that woman; that she will not depend on Rochester. Jane\u2019s pride has made her more compelling to Rochester and it makes his love for her stronger. Awaiting their marriage another tragic event happens that postpones the wedding even longer. While there was a first attempt to a wedding, Rochester strangely tries to resume the ceremony as someone quickly interrupts and rejects why they should get married. Rochester is confronted with the news and proof that he was still married to another woman named Bertha. While they crowd was invited to see why she was kept a secret Jane departures herself for a while until she recovers. While this crazy event was happening Jane picked up her inherited five thousand pounds that was split between her and her cousins. Rochester is blinded by a fire that happens at Thornfield when it is burned down and his legally married wife Bertha was killed in that fire attempting to kill Rochester. Jane is left with twenty thousand pounds when her uncle John dies and eventually gets back to Rochester. With the drama that has diluted and faded away Jane and Rochester picked up where they stopped and ends up getting married. It is important to know that Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight and she still seeks the love she had for him. Jane and Rochester had been married happily for ten years, after two years in to their marriage they have a baby boy and Rochester claims to be getting his sight back in one eye when he says he is able to see their son when he holds him for the first time. Jane completes a life of struggle and tough challenges through faith and pride. Her belief in God and using his guidance lead her to a life that she never thought she would have growing 7 up as a little girl. She survives through her times of loneliness and provides herself with the ability to be independent to seek happiness. Jane shows the definition and the difference of loneliness and independence. She uses her feelings of emotions to motivate her to achieve independence by assuring that she will be able provide for herself before she completes her life with happiness. She seeks happiness when she realizes that she has love in her life but refuses to take the offer of love until she was able to create stability by being independent in the process. Jane ends up being of more fortune of Rochester and still being able to have the love she wanted with him by sticking with her faith and pride and guidance from the love of God. The story and rough journey of Jane Eyre, ends up being the happy Jane Rochester.", "length": 3113}

At the core of the ecosystem is the Fresh Earth Token, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business. The token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem, and is valued based on both the value of the ecosystem's assets and the future impact of regenerative projects on the environment and society. The Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to incentivize participation and engagement through a variety of different Incentive Drivers and includes a B2B and B2C marketplace, a Project Management Platform, a Data Managment Platform, and a Rewards System. The ecosystem aims to provide a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume, while also promoting sustainable practices and addressing the pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security.\n\n1.

Background\nContext: Agrifood-health-environment\nThe world is currently facing a number of pressing interlinking issues including climate change, health, and food security. \n\nClimate change and environmental degradation are causing extreme weather events and altering growing conditions, threatening to cross tipping points for the biosphere and the continuance of civilization as we have known it. Industrial agriculture by itself is the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, pollution, biodiversity loss, and decline in soil health and water availability. This is resulting in reduced crop yields and increased food insecurity, which is putting added pressure on farmers to produce more food using conventional, industrial agricultural practices that accelerate degrade the environmental degradation. \n \n\nOn the health front, the agri-food industry is facing challenges as a result of soil degradation and chemical inputs, leading to a decrease in nutritional density of food and an increase in food-borne illnesses and food toxicity. Furthermore, the current industrial agriculture system is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, contributing to air and water pollution, and negatively impacting the health of farmers and rural communities.\n\nThe current food system is inadequate in addressing food security issues, with millions of people suffering from hunger and malnourishment. It is estimated that around 33% of global food production is lost or wasted, while around 800 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition. The industrial agriculture system is designed for maximum efficiency and profit, rather than for the benefit of communities and the environment. This has led to monoculture farming, overuse of chemicals, and a lack of diversity in the food system, all of which contribute to poor health and food insecurity. \n\nConsumers are becoming aware of these environmental and heath problems and are increasingly demanding high-quality, sustainably produced food, and the market for organic and functional food is growing rapidly. To address these challenges, there is a growing movement towards regenerative agriculture practices, which focus on regenerating soil health, water availability, and biodiversity while producing food in a sustainable manner. \n\nHowever, the lack of coordination and fragmentation in the agricultural industry makes it difficult for small farmers and regenerative agriculture projects to access the capital needed to transition to sustainanble and regenerative practices, and scale up their operations.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to address these issues by promoting regenerative agriculture practices and creating a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume.\n\nThe deep problems - the economic system\nExternalization of costs\nThe current economic system, which prioritizes capitalism and consumerism, fails to account for the true cost of industrial agriculture, or commerce generally, on the environment and human health. Farmers who want to grow crops using sustainable methods have to invest in the transition only to find they are is outcompeted by industrial practices that have not internalised their true costs to environment and health. This leads to unsustainable practices, such as monoculture and heavy use of chemical inputs, that degrade the soil, reduce biodiversity and increase greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. These externalised costs are effectively subsidised by the individuals of the society who ultimately bear the cost of damages to environment and health. On a true free market baiss, with all costs accounted for, the regenerative and degenerative methods can compete on an equal basis. The degenerative methods with their burden of environmental, health and expensive inputs costs (fertiliser, pesticides etc) are no longer competitive with regenerative practices that do not have these costs. Additionally in a world where regeneration is valued it can become an additional source of income, ultimately making the regenerative products cheaper. This highlights the need for a comprehensive accounting of natural capital and internalization of environmental and health costs in order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system.\n\nThe Monetary system\n\nThe monetary system, which is based on fractional reserve banking and debt-based money creation, also exacerbates this issue by creating a cycle of debt repayment. The root of this problem lies in the way that money is created and the lack of accounting for natural capital. Most money is created by commercial banks originating loans (\u201cPromises to Repay\u201d), which creates an increase in deposit accounts (\u201cMoney\u201d). This creates a cycle of loan repayment that must come from some form of commerce, predominatly based based on fossil fuel energy. Because there is no accounting for natural capital, the ultimate source of the repayment is a reduction in natural capital assets, i.e. the destruction of environmental and health assets. This is seen in IMF loans to third world countries that are permanently indebted and required to mine their natural capital, even their food, to pay the interest.\n\nFurthermore, this would be the case even if the energy source were some form of non-polluting, free energy. Greenhouse gas damage is only a fraction of the total environmental and health cost of the commerce systema. As long as the destruction of nature is free of cost, and money is debt based withotu regard to social value, the competitive race to the bottom will ensure that nature and health are destroyed even faster. This highlights the need for a comprehensive accounting of natural capital and the internalization of environmental and health costs in order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system.\n\nIn short, our current economic system is not taking into account the true cost of industrial agriculture and or other commerce on the environment and human health. This results in farmers and industry being incentivized to adopt practices that are not sustainable in the long term. Additionally, a lack of coordination and fragmentation in the agricultural industry makes it difficult for small farmers and regenerative agriculture projects to access the capital they need to scale up their operations. The root of this problem lies in the way that money is created and the lack of accounting for natural capital. In order to create a more sustainable and equitable economic system, we need to take into account the comprehensive accounting of natural capital and the internalization of environmental and health costs.\n\nEconomic Costs of the degenerative system\nThe degenerative industrial agriculture industry is facing a multitude of challenges that threaten global food security, economic stability, and human health. These issues, if left unaddressed, will result in staggering economic and health costs for society.\n\nIt's difficult to put a precise monetary value on the costs associated with the degenerative food industry as they can vary greatly depending on the specific impact and location, and many of these costs are not immediately visible and can accumulate over time. However, some estimates have been made on certain aspects of the industry. \n\nEconomic impact of food insecurity, including loss in GDP in developing countries due to micronutrient deficiencies is up to 2% of GDP according to Global Hunger Index 2014)\n\nGlobal loss in economic productivity due to macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies is over 2-3% of GDP\n\nThe total cost of climate change is estimated to be around 2-4% of global GDP by 2100, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. (Greenhouse gas emissions from the food sector are estimated to be around 25% of global emissions.)\n\nExternalized damages of the $1T US food industry is estimated in a 2021 Rockerfeller Report at $2.1T\n\nAnnual healthcare costs globally due to diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease is estimated by World Health Organization at $2 trillion.\n\nDeforestation caused by industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $2-5 trillion annually in lost ecosystem services.\n\nLoss of biodiversity caused by industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $500 billion annually.\n\nThe use of chemical inputs in industrial agriculture is estimated to cost around $5.2 billion annually in health costs in the US alone.\n\nWater pollution caused by agricultural activities is estimated to cost around $452 billion annually.\n\nIn a $100 trillion Global GDP, these estimated costs aggregate to $11-17 trillion.", "length": 3248}
{"prompt": "The increasing pressure on farmers to produce more using unsustainable practices, can lead to overuse of resources, and soil degradation, further exacerbating the aforementioned issues and costs, leading to potential food insecurity and economic instability.\n\nIn conclusion, the industrial agriculture industry is facing a multitude of challenges that threaten global food security, economic stability, and human health. These issues, if left unaddressed, will result in staggering costs for society. It is imperative that we take action now to address these challenges and transition to sustainable and equitable food systems.\n\nOn the other hand these costs represent an opportunity. They can be mined and used as fuel to drive a regenerative economy instead of a degenerative economy.\n\nThe solution - Internalization of costs\nImagine a world where the true cost of industrial agriculture and other industries are accounted for in our economic system. Instead of incentivizing farmers and companies to adopt unsustainable practices, such as monoculture and heavy use of chemical inputs, we would be encouraging them to adopt sustainable, regenerative practices that benefit both the environment and human health. This can be achieved by implementing fees on pollution and the use of resources, such as carbon and water.\n\nInternalizing these costs not only benefits the environment, but it also leads to greater innovation, efficiency, job creation, and ultimately lower costs for society as a whole. Additionally, by implementing a fee and dividend system, where a portion of the fees collected are distributed back to the public, we can ensure that this solution is not regressive and that the most vulnerable members of society are not disproportionately impacted.\n\nHowever, few governments have taken the necessary steps to implement this solution (only Austria switzerland and six canadian provinces have implemented a fee and dividend on carbon pollution). That's where the Fresh Earth token comes in. By utilizing blockchain technology, the Fresh Earth token aims to create a transparent and verifiable impact for sustainable agrifood projects, and stimulate investment in regenerative agriculture. By taking this approach, we can work towards a future where the cost of destroying our environment and human health is no longer externalized, but internalized and paid for by those who are causing the damage.\n\nThe opportunity\nThere is a growing demand for change in the food industry, driven by consumers who are increasingly concerned about the quality and sustainability of their food. Digitization and the lack of it in the supply chain also creates an opportunity for innovation and disruption in the agricultural industry. The Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to address these issues and create a more sustainable, resilient food system.\n\nThe opportunity to create positive impacts by transforming the Agri-food industry is enormous and many are now pursuing it.\n\nAgriculture and food could be the biggest solution by regenerating land and health.\n\nAn Agri-Food revolution is already underway.\n\nHundreds of billions of $ are looking to invest in it.\n\nAgri-food and health are each $10T global industries, with a combined true cost of $50T.\n\nIf people had to spend twice as much to get Regen food, it would still be cheaper + healthier.\n\nAgri-food is the least digitized of the major industries.\n\nIn the US, 40% of produce is wasted and food loss accounts for 8% of GHG gas emissions.\n\nConsumer awareness and demand for more eco-friendly & healthy food is rapidly growing.\n\nThe industry is fragmented with duplication of effort and gaps in existing approaches, and limited coordination between new initiatives. Solutions lack scale and synergy.\n\nRegenerative agriculture is currently being adopted to millions of hectares globally.\n\nHigh tech methods, including for measurement and validation, are rapidly progressing.\n\nGov. and private initiatives, including the X prize, will boost everything.\n\nNone of this is big and fast enough to regenerate faster than we degenerate.\n\nThis means huge opportunity if approached at scale and with \u2018outside the box\u2019 solutionsThe Fresh Earth Ecosystem\n\n3. The Fresh Earth ecosystem\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is a revolutionary solution for transforming the agri-food industry and addressing pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security. By creating a global, community-based food system, Fresh Earth empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume. The system is designed to internalize the costs of the food system and redistribute the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards, creating an economic engine for the ecosystem. By incentivizing participation and engagement, the Fresh Earth token driven system acts as an impact generation machine at scale, driving participation, investment, and the transition to regenerative practices.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is composed of several key components that intermesh to drive participation, investment and the transition to regenerative practices. These include:\n\nFresh Earth Token: At the heart of the ecosystem is the Fresh Earth Token, a powerful tool that represents fractional ownership of the food ecosystem business, serving as a store of value that can be held by stakeholders as a liquid financial reservoir, retaining its value and purchasing power over time. It leverages the future impact of regenerative projects to secure external funding from government schemes such as carbon trading, and ESG investors. it also drives the Rewards System, incentivizing participation and engagement of stakeholders within the ecosystem, including farmers, consumers, and investors, towards the common goal of regenerating land and promoting sustainable practices. \n\nData Managment Platform: Based on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density, this is a science-driven approach to measuring and validating the impact outcomes of regenerative practices and projects.

Retention Credit UPDATE 2023 - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"the employee retention credit also known as ERC is a federal program that is still available as of right now for business owners with W-2 employees on the books during 2020 and 2021. so today I'm going to share with you one of the ways you could see how much you qualify for apply online and get ready to file for those funds from the IRS so stick around you're not going to want to miss this so you heard right many business owners have already heard about the employee retention credit also known as ERC what many don't realize is that you can still file as of this recording retroactively both for three quarters in 2020 and three quarters in 2021. now unless there's changes from like Congress or the IRS the deadline to file for 2020 is actually like the middle of April in 2024 and the deadline to file for 2021 is actually the middle of April for 2025. so I'm going to leave a link Down Below in the description for you to check out a free questionnaire you can type in some of your information check some of the boxes where you were impacted and come back with a number down to the penny of exactly how much of this money you're entitled to oh and real quick drop a like for this video alright so over here is how the application page starts I've partnered with the good Folks at the ERC specialist their business out of Utah that's been around for going on a couple years now and all they do is process employee retention credits for small business owners 24 7. of course it's a good idea to check with like your local CPA or your your payroll department but honestly it's been so long that if they have told you you don't qualify it's at least worth taking a second look at an application like this so here we go I'm going to check the box that says start new application now if you need to like save your work and come back that's fine you can do that here they're going to ask for your company name this should be on all your official documents your articles of organization your business checking account go ahead and put your first and last name also your best business email address and business phone number then again this is where all the correspondents are going to go for ERC so if you want to put your you know your personal email or your personal cell that works too now what's really cool about this questionnaire is that it will estimate and show you your progress as you go it's only an estimate but for this section they're going to ask for your average full-time W-2 employees for 2020 and then your average full-time W-2 employees for 2021. it's worth noting that you're full-time according to the IRS if you work at least like on average 30 hours a week or 130 hours in a month one of the really cool things to all my business owners that employ part-time workers or seasonal workers you can yes include all of them in this questionnaire but for the sake of this section just do the average number of full-time and right here go ahead and check this little box it just says that you're opting into getting started and getting all the info once you're done with the questionnaire let's go ahead and click let's get started all right on this next screen I want to point out that little progress bar at the top that little blue progress bar and again they're going to give you some like estimated numbers but really the steps the procedures as you're going along are to answer the questions in the questionnaire to upload some specific payroll docs and then get in contact with ERC Specialists to actually sign all the documentation and get this return filed with the IRS it's going to prep you that you do want to get some things together like if the average number of employees you had in 2019 that's actually because they're going to compare 2019 to 2020 and 2019 to 2021. you're also going to need your gross receipts for 2019 uh 2020 and 2021 this is for that like Revenue reduction qualifier that we'll we'll get into later and you're going to want to gather any ways that you know government orders shutdown orders supply chain issues impacted your business so that can include names of vendors items things you had trouble getting okay moving on it's going to ask you straight up did you pay W2 wages unfortunately this is not for 1099 employees it's not for people you paid with cash these had to be people you paid as W-2 workers you already paid payroll tax to them you filed those forms those 941s with the IRS paid that money and so then if that applies to you go ahead and click the yes real quick there's always like little exceptions to the rules and they do need to know any of the majority owners of the business and their family members so anyone who owns 51 or more of the business you gotta list their name and all their immediate family we're talking literally everybody you can think of that works in the business and gets paid as a W-2 employee I've been getting questions like I get questions all the time kind of like well what if I only own 50 well then in that case you don't own 51 or more so you're not considered a majority owner there's always some like little exceptions to all the rules and that's one of them that I did want to at least like make note of and point out and now here they're asking if you are a federal state or local entity if you are most likely you're excluded from this program so you would know if you are click yes and if you're not click no and then move on they do need to know if you started your business before or after February 15 2020. if you started it after you're going to be like sort of referred to as a different kind of business entity for the purposes of this program so whenever you officially started just go ahead and put that down and now I mentioned it before they're going to compare everything to 2019 so they're asking how many full-time employees did you have on average in 2019 this is a really interesting rule because again part-time workers seasonal workers you can have as many as you want but they did set limitations to try to help smaller businesses small business owners okay clicking ahead here's that important screen it's going to talk about Revenue reduction supply chain disruption and full or partial shutdown these are going to be the three qualifiers for the six available quarters we're talking three in 2020 and three in 2021. so you need to go ahead and say like did you experience this and if so in which quarters you might say to yourself well rich am I supposed to know that well for Revenue reduction what we'll get into is there's a certain amount of Revenue reduction they're a little bit more generous in 2020 compared to 2021 for a supply chain if you had trouble getting like a very important item to you it could be a good material a service something like 10 or more of your business then you're going to qualify and for full or partial shutdown in some states they said hey you know you guys can stay open but you can only have limited seating oh no you can't stay open at all we got to shut down anytime those orders were in place you can check that box for that quarter all right so let's go ahead and continue on for the sake of this application I want to show people that you can still qualify even if you didn't have a revenue reduction or even if you weren't like fully shut down due to some sort of governmental order but I still will walk people through just in case these other qualifiers apply so right here for Revenue reduction you had to have a 50 reduction of gross sales in 22 20 compared to 2019 in those same quarters it's kind of just like basic math you got to look at Q2 3 and 4 of 2020 and compare it to the same quarter in 2019. for 2021 they were a bit more generous you only needed a 20 reduction of gross sales when you're comparing it to that same quarter in 2019. of course you are going to need your own records to back this up but click yes if it applies for the sake of this application I'm going to click no so now as you can see it moves us to the supply chain disruption screen this application is adaptive so if I would have said yes to having some sort of Revenue reduction it would have asked me which quarters I said no so now it's moving me on go ahead and click these two links here notice 2021-11 and 2821-20 this is the IRS explanation of how supply chain disruption applies to the employee retention credit so let's go ahead and read this over real quick this is when people want to understand and supply chain disruption is a common qualification for businesses that rely on vendors and suppliers for their business to function properly this qualification must have resulted from a government suspension order to your supplier that resulted in the supplier not being able to deliver critical Goods but may continue beyond the original suspension order the specific requirements are listed in those two links that I just set the way I like to explain it to people is if your supplier makes everything overseas and they need to ship it in through the port of New York and New York was in a state of emergency and the ports were closed down then your supplier couldn't get you your items and as a result you couldn't function in the same way as pre-pandemic as 2019. now there is one exception if it is something that you could find a reasonable replacement supplier for then this wouldn't qualify you but what is a reasonable replacement supplier from my experience it is going to be a supplier that can provide you with the exact same item without getting into a lot of examples and I have a whole video I'll post it right here on on supply chain disruption people had to change the way they did business and as a result they couldn't do business in the same way meaning volume meaning you know basically serving their customers in a way where they had become accustomed to for years on end so supply chain covers a wide area no one's going to know your business your suppliers your vendors better than you but now that we discussed it a little bit let's Dive Right In let's go ahead and click continue and I am going to say yes and I am going to say for all six quarters they're going to want us to note that we were not able to find a reasonable replacement supplier for any of the disrupted items because we said yes to that is going to Simply Now move us on to full or partial suspension there's a whole list of suspension orders that you can look up for your state for your category of business and if you want to read a little bit of here it gives some IRS examples of course like a restaurant that was able to do take out but not uh you know sit down dining employers who were able to maybe have a like a skeleton crew on but they weren't able to do anything for like you know telecommuting like for Zoom or for Google meets anything like that can be considered a part social shutdown so go ahead and click yes if you know that this affected your business in that way before we move on I'll even note that there is this little video you can like kind of press and watch and have someone explain to you like did you experience a full or partial shutdown I really love this updated application so check that part out for the sake of this application just to kind of make this video not too long I'm going to go ahead and click no and it's going to say congratulations you qualified for all six available quarters and now again it's just going to confirm some information it already asked me how on average how many employees did I have in 2020 that were W-2 on average how many employees did I have in 2021 that were W-2 and then you're gonna see a screen that looks like this that says great news here's an estimate this is going to be like a best case scenario but they really need to take a look at your documents how much did you actually pay in wages how many employees did you pay if you had more employees in one quarter than another again 2021 was more generous than 2020. so you are are already off to like a good start but you do need to upload those documents so it's going to say please add these two emails so nothing goes to spam and then it just wants you to confirm all of your business information you're going to have to add in your title in the company the company address just to like verify one more time it's going to ask like what industry you're in and if you want to include like an optional email address of someone that handles your than another again 2021 was more generous than 2020. so you are are already off to like a good start but you do need to upload those documents so it's going to say please add these two emails so nothing goes to spam and then it just wants you to confirm all of your business information you're going to have to add in your title in the company the company address just to like verify one more time it's going to ask like what industry you're in and if you want to include like an optional email address of someone that h the next 24 hours upload those payroll documents but for the sake of this application for the sake of this video keeping it short I'm just going to flash on the screen right now a little pick picture of everything that you need to get together and upload if you don't have it uploaded already if you would like a copy of that I will leave a link Down Below in the description anybody that signs up using my link to just like kind of sniff around this application try it out for themselves I'll send you government grants that you may have got go ahead and select the answer that applies to you and now it's time to either manually upload everything like you got like a PDF or an Excel file or they actually have an automatic upload option which is really cool I'm going to click on that so you can see what it looks like if you're familiar you're with plaid or other types of services that can like automatically link like to your bank or to your payroll system this is just like that so you can go ahead in the beginning nobody reall\"\n\nPlease write in English

{"prompt": "This is the next part of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\" Item 1 \u2013 Front facade\n\nThe first item complained of by the homeowner is that the front fa\u00e7ade of the house was not constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications set out in the Contract, and that therefore there has been a breach of the warranty in s 18B(1)(a) of the Act.\n\nIt was not disputed by the respondent that the construction of the front fa\u00e7ade departs from the architectural drawings which formed part of the Contract. The drawings depict a projection at the top of the front fa\u00e7ade forming a parapet over a window identified in the drawings as W4. The parapet has not been constructed and instead an aluminium shade hood has been installed.\n\nThe homeowner says that he did not agree to this variation and that the variation did not have development consent.\n\nThis reasoning is problematic for a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly the evidence does not establish that development approval was required for this relatively minor change. The homeowner\u2019s expert Mr Nakhla asserted that in his experience as a builder such a change would require development approval. The builder\u2019s expert Mr Coombes asserted that in his opinion a minor change of this nature would not require development approval. Neither expert has expertise in planning regulation and law and no evidence from such an expert was provided.\n\nMoreover, Mr Nakhla\u2019s own evidence given under cross-examination was that the development was ultimately approved by a certifier and an occupancy certificate was issued.\n\nHaving considered the available evidence, I am not satisfied that the modification of the front fa\u00e7ade required planning approval.\n\nIn any event, the evidence establishes that the homeowner approved the change. In this regard Mr Taki relies on the following email exchange which he says occurred between the parties on 6 March 2020:\n\nMr Taki: I am just confirming that we are replacing the small louvre roof over window 4 with an aluminium shade-hood. This for both window 4 and sliding door 1 \u2026 can you please confirm this change as we are liable to pay a deposit. Once you have agreed to this replacement it is final\u2026\u201d\n\nMr Bahboota: Hi Adam, thanks for your email. As discussed, I am confirming.\n\nA copy of the email exchange is attached to the Coombes\u2019 Report.\n\nThe homeowner did not present any evidence refuting that this email exchange took place, and did not cross-examine Mr Taki in relation to his evidence in this regard. I accept Mr Taki\u2019s evidence and am satisfied that this exchange between the parties took place\n\nClause 14 of the Contract (which is in the form of the Master Builders Association BC 4 standard form contract) deals with variations to the work to be done under the Contract. Interpretation of that clause was discussed in detail in Paraiso v CBS Build Pty Ltd [2020] NSWSC 190 (Paraiso) at [32]-[57] and [60]. The Court found that Clause 14(d)(i) is to the same effect as cl 1(2) of Pt 1 of Sch 2 of the Act, which is statutorily imported under s 7E. That is, any agreement to vary the contract, or the plans and specifications for work to be done under the contract, must be in writing signed by or on behalf of each party.\n\nThis interpretation is also consistent with clause 1(c)(ii) of the Contract.\n\nIn Paraiso the Court suggested at [60] and at [62] that variations to a building contract which do not bear a handwritten signature but which are transmitted by email may nonetheless satisfy the requirements of the Electronic Transactions Act 2000 (NSW). Sections 8 and 9 of that Act relevantly provide:\n\n8 Writing\n\n(1) If, under a law of this jurisdiction, a person is required to give information in writing, that requirement is taken to have been met if the person gives the information by means of an electronic communication, where\u2014\n\n(a) at the time the information was given, it was reasonable to expect that the information would be readily accessible so as to be useable for subsequent reference, and\n\n(b) the person to whom the information is required to be given consents to the information being given by means of an electronic communication.\n\n\u2026\n\n9 Signatures\n\n(1) If, under a law of this jurisdiction, the signature of a person is required, that requirement is taken to have been met in relation to an electronic communication if\u2014\n\n(a) a method is used to identify the person and to indicate the person\u2019s intention in respect of the information communicated, and\n\n(b) the method used was either\u2014\n\n(i) as reliable as appropriate for the purpose for which the electronic communication was generated or communicated, in the light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement, or\n\n(ii) proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions described in paragraph (a), by itself or together with further evidence, and\n\n(c) the person to whom the signature is required to be given consents to that requirement being met by way of the use of the method mentioned in paragraph (a).\n\nUnder section 5 of the Electronic Transactions Act \u201cconsent\u201d is defined to include \u201cconsent that can reasonably be inferred from the conduct of the person concerned, but does not include consent given subject to conditions unless the conditions are complied with\u201d.\n\nIt is also relevant in this regard to refer to clause 30 of the Contract which states:\n\nAll notices (and/or other documents) will be deemed to have been given, received or served if sent to the other party at the relevant address, email address or facsimile number nominated in the Contract or the address last communicated in writing to the person giving the notice.\n\nThe email address provided for the homeowner in the Contract is Mr Bahboota\u2019s email address.\n\nGiven the current prevalence of email communication as a preferred means of communication, and that the Contract specifically permits provision of notices by email, I am satisfied that the email exchange of 6 March 2020 satisfies the requirements of s 8 of the Electronic Transactions Act and that the exchange of emails on 6 March 2020 detailed the proposed variation to the plans in writing.\n\nConsidering now the requirement for the agreed variation to be signed:\n\nThe use of email as contemplated by the Contract, together with the wording of Mr Taki\u2019s email, and in particular the words \u201cCan you please confirm this change, as we are liable to pay a deposit. Once you have agreed to this replacement, it is final\u201d, together in my view satisfy the requirements of s 9(1)(a) and 9(1)(b)(i) of the Electronic Transactions Act.\n\nAlthough neither party specifically stated that they consented to the requirement for a signature being met by way of the email exchange, it can be reasonably inferred from the conduct of the parties (including in particular the statement in Mr Taki\u2019s email \u201cOnce you have agreed to this replacement it is final\u201d and the homeowner\u2019s response \u201cI am confirming\u201d), that both parties consented, for the purposes of s 9(1)(c), to the requirement for a signature being met by way of the email exchange,\n\nand that therefore the email exchange satisfies the requirement for a signature of each party.\n\nFor these reasons I am satisfied that pursuant to the exchange of emails on 6 March 2020, the parties consented to vary the plans and specifications attached to the Contract insofar as they related to the front fa\u00e7ade parapet, and that the exchange of emails satisfied the requirements of the Contract and of the Act that the variation be detailed in writing signed by or on behalf of the parties.\n\nThere is no evidence which establishes that the works done by the builder are inconsistent in any way with the variation detailed in the exchange of emails (and indeed Mr Nakhla conceded during cross-examination that although he had not taken any measurements of the shade-hood, visually it appeared consistent with what was agreed in the email exchange).\n\nAccordingly, I am not satisfied that the works were not done in accordance with the plans and specifications set out in the contract and therefore this part of the claim fails.\n\nI would add that even if the analysis above was incorrect, and there was no valid variation to the plans and specifications for the front facade, I would nonetheless have declined to make the work order sought by the homeowner. Under s 48O of the Act, the Tribunal is empowered to make any one or more of a range of orders when determining a building claim \u201cas it considers appropriate\u201d. In this case:\n\nThe builder asked the homeowner, in the 6 March exchange of emails, to confirm his consent to the variation;\n\nThe homeowner was on notice that once he consented, the builder would consider the change final and would be outlaying a deposit for the new shade hood;\n\nThe homeowner represented to the builder that he consented to the variation;\n\nThe builder proceeded to build the fa\u00e7ade in accordance with the 6 March email exchange and with no objection from the homeowner until well after the dwelling had been constructed;\n\nThe builder relied on the homeowner\u2019s representation and built the fa\u00e7ade accordingly;\n\nThere is no evidence that the change requires development approval;\n\nThe works proposed by the homeowner to change the fa\u00e7ade to conform with the original drawings are not trivial. Mr Nakhla estimates a cost of $42,194 for this work and Mr Coombes estimates $10,239.\n\nConsidering all of the circumstances, in my view it would be inappropriate to compel the builder to incur the cost of changing the front fa\u00e7ade.\n\nItem 2 \u2013 Water ingress to garage\n\nThe parties\u2019 experts agree that there is water penetration into the garage ceiling which requires rectification, but disagree as to the source of the water ingress and the appropriate method of rectification.\n\nThe experts also agree that once the defects are rectified, the garage ceiling will need to be patched and repaired.\n\nMr Nakhla says that he has identified the following defects in the construction of the garage roof:\n\nThe far left garage downpipe in box gutter has no sump and the pipe is installed flush with the box gutter;\n\nOn the far right side over the garage there are large visible gaps at the junctions of the masonry column and stone cladding;\n\nThere is no water stop angle behind the sliding doors (required by AS 4654.2) and no overflow provision installed to the enclosed balcony.\n\nWith regard to the installation of the far left garage downpipe and absence of a sump, the Nakhla Report provides no explanation as to why these issues render the installation of the pipework defective, and no explanation as to why Mr Nakhla has formed the view that these issues have resulted in water ingress. For example, the report does not refer to any relevant standard or code requirement, nor any other literature or materials used to support Mr Nakhla\u2019s opinion (other than photographs), and the report identifies no tests or investigations conducted to establish that these issues have resulted in water ingress.\n\nSimilarly, with regard to the gaps observed at the junctures of the cladded wall and the rendered masonry, the report does not contain any measurements or other data, or any reference to industry standards or code requirements, which support Mr Nakhla\u2019s conclusion that the gaps constitute defects. Moreover, there is no reliable evidence that the gaps have caused the water ingress. In particular, there is no evidence of tests or investigations carried out by Mr Nakhla in this regard and indeed there is no evidence at all which shows that the gaps penetrate further than the surface of the wall.\n\nIn short, Mr Nakhla\u2019s evidence in relation to the first two of these issues do not establish the facts on which his opinions are based in order that I can be satisfied that there is a proper foundation for his opinion that those aspects of the garage roof are defective: see Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705; [2001] NSWCA 305 at [85] (Makita).\n\nWith regard to the water stop angle, Mr Coombes says that it is not possible to state conclusively that there is no water stop angle alongside the door frame. He says it is possible that the water stop angle is concealed by the timber strip which has been installed alongside the door frame. He also refers to a copy of a waterproofing certificate certifying that the work has been done in accordance with AS 3740 (although no copy of the relevant standard has been provided).\n\nMr Coombes was not cross-examined in relation to this evidence and no persuasive explanation was given by Mr Nakhla as to why he does not agree that the water stop angle may be concealed. Having considered the evidence of both experts in relation to this matter, I am satisfied that it is possible that the water stop angle is concealed by the timber strip identified by Mr Coombes and therefore am not satisfied that the builder has failed to install a water stop angle.\n\nMr Coombes says that there are no emergency overflow provisions to the enclosed balcony or the two box gutters at either end of the balcony. He also says that the water damage to the garage ceiling at the southern end is due to the installation of the outlet pipe which is immediately above this location. He says there is no flange around the top of the outlet pipe and consequently water can travel down the outside of the pipe as well as down the inside.\n\nMr Coombes recommends an invasive inspection of the pipework within the ceiling void so that it can be inspected for leaks at the joins. He also recommends installation of a flange around the top of the outlet pipe and installation of 50 mm emergency overflow pipes through the masonry walls of both box gutters and the enclosed balcony.\n\nMr Coombes was not cross-examined about his evidence in relation to any of these matters. Moreover, his report provides a more detailed explanation of the facts and observations on which his opinions regarding the water ingress are based, so that I am comfortably satisfied that there is a proper foundation for his opinions in relation to these matters.\n\nFor these reasons I prefer Mr Coombes\u2019 evidence in relation to the cause of the water ingress and the method of rectification and am making an order that rectification works to the garage roof be done in accordance with the scope of works in the Coombes Report.", "length": 3400}

where we give the insider's perspective on the us visa interview process hi everyone i am so excited to be here with you all today for the inaugural episode of our podcast behind the visa window with ex visa officers my name is mandy fierbacher and this is my colleague ben arterburn and we started this podcast mainly because when we were ex-visa officers with the u. s department of state i don't know about you ben but i just felt like there were so many things that were misunderstood about the us visa process and things that you could not possibly know unless you were actually a visa officer working behind that glass and one of the reasons why i wanted to do this with you is because i felt like there are so many insights we gleaned with our years working with the state department at u. s embassies and consulates around the world and and seeing what some people went through during that process made me really want to help these applicants and international citizens because it is a very opaque process it's difficult to understand um and you know we kind of bring a unique perspective given our uh work experience oh yeah it's definitely a black box you know the embassy's there um and they think they've given all the information to the visa applicants that they need in order to apply for their visa but they haven't you know there's a there's an environment of misinformation there's visa agents there's people online there's your friends there's your family who have applied for visas and things have gone well or maybe they've gone wrong and everyone's reading the tea leaves trying to figure out what's actually going on and no one really knows that's why we wanted to do this we want to shed light on that on what's actually going on inside why are people getting their visas refused right unnecessarily you know two people who have the same experience they went to school together they studied together they got into the same university they've applied for the same majors they're going to study in the us at the same university one gets approved once gets denied and no one knows why but we've got that insight mandy how many visa interviews did you do while you're in so i have interviewed probably over a hundred thousand visa applicants and it was a lot of time talking to people talking to people from all different walks of life who had different motivations going to the united states and unfortunately every single visa interview uh was very short and so i didn't have a whole lot of time to talk to each person uh but i do have a lot of experience in knowing what these officers look for um you know what kinds of questions we ask and exactly what is our culture because i don't know if you feel like this ben but i honestly feel like these officers or consular officers as we're called have our own culture in how we make these decisions and why we think about things a certain way what do you think oh yeah definitely um it's not all written down in the law right there's there's the legal requirements to get your visa and the immigration attorneys know those requirements inside it out you know that's their profession but then once the v sapling visa applicant goes into the visa interview and is standing there with the glass between them and the visa officer all of it just decide is decided upon the mentality of that visa officer right then and there right um they have to overcome 214b as they say right and that just is in the feelings in the in the in the judgment of that visa officer and i know for me this uh this idea of wanting to help visa visa applicants was born when one of my very good friends applied for a visa and because you know there's a there's really strict ethics rules for the visa officers you can't you can't help people on the outside while you're working as a visa officer i told my friend that i couldn't help them but i said you're not going to have any problems just go through it on your own apply it'll be fine and she got refused and i had no idea why i said this is a mistake go ahead and apply again i didn't help her you know abiding by our strict ethics i said just go ahead and apply again she applied again and she got refused again and i realized that this system is imperfect nobody knows what's going on on the outside and now i'm grateful that we have the opportunity and that we're starting this platform to try to shed some light on this um i guess i'll go ahead and introduce myself a little bit you know what my background was uh i started with the state department in 2012 and i was a visa officer in guangzhou china i had a background in china before that i had lived in china for about five or six years studying and then working um and also had a degree in chinese studies so that was kind of my bread and butter so i did two years of visas in guangzhou where i did non-immigrant visas and also immigrant visas i also did american citizen services which is another aspect of the consular work abroad but that's for a different podcast and then after that i was sent to bogota colombia where i also did non-immigrant visas but also i worked in the fraud prevention unit which is the unit where if someone is suspected of committing fraud their case is referred over and we investigated right so we had a you know a team of investigators and we looked into this and i found you know a lot of times there is fraud right that's why the police officers do have their their radars turned on is because some people are committing fraud telling lies in order to get past the visa officers and make it to the united states but also in that role i found that sometimes people seemed like you know something was off but then after an investigation there was nothing wrong luckily those cases had been referred to us and we could do an investigation and prove that they were actually legitimate in their study plan and their tourism plan or business plan but in other instances the officers at the window would never have referred those cases to us and they would have just referred them they would have refused them outright so you know knowing how that works is really you know an important thing my final job in the state department was as the spokesperson and press secretary at the u. s consulate in shanghai and i resigned from the state department in 2018 and ever since then i've been helping visa applicants get their visas that's great ben and you know similarly you and i actually have a lot in common because we have this china experience i am also a former visa officer uh just like yourself and interestingly enough my visa experience started when i was very young so i am an immigrant myself i was actually born in shanghai china where you ended your career with the state department and i went to my visa interview at the age of seven at the u.s consulate in shanghai um this would have been the old consulate though so i don't think that was the one where you were working but it was a really eye-opening experience for me as a seven-year-old child i remember going into the consulate and just thinking gosh like this is crazy that this person who you know this white man with very long hair by the way he seemed kind of like a hippie could speak chinese and ask me questions and he asked me why i wanted to go to the united states um the reason was that my at the u.s consulate in shanghai um this would have been the old consulate though so i don't think that was the one where you were working but it was a really eye-opening experience for me as a seven-year-old child i remember going into the consulate and just thinking gosh like this is cra where we were extremely extremely busy um i don't know if you know actually i'm sure that was your experience as well in guangzhou china but all of the posts in china are extremely busy and we call ourselves visa mills it's not like a great you know term because it just showcased how busy we were but i remember at the embassy in beijing regularly on a daily basis about 4 400 people would come through our waiting room and every single person needed to be interviewed and at the embassy in beijing china i and so that was really interesting for me and i did my next tour um at a border town called matamoros mexico so that was at the us consulate in mexico where i worked again in non-immigrant visas but i also spent a year working in american citizen services on u.s passport issues and i spent my final two years at the u. know we we've seen the whole gamut um in in china in latin america um there's a there's a whole lot of variety in these but then you've done that many of them and you've seen um you know the wide swath of experiences that people have when they're applying for for visas um what can happen when they go in why people get refused why people get issued you know and after doing it for so many years i don't know if you're familiar we haven't i don't know if we've talked about this the malcolm gladwell's ten wanna toot our own horns too much but we definitely are um we we have a very specialized skill set that we have become masters of throughout the course of our careers department um all of it doing visas you actually had some work outside of the consular section but for me it was all in visas i felt like during that time i just kind of lived and breathed visas and so it's really interesting that you and i are doing visa consulting work now with argo because you know the really interesting thing to me is at the time we were visa officers we had situation in two minutes i mean how many how many interviews would you say you did every day oh it depended but one day i think that the max number of in-person face-to-face interviews that i did was 280. oh my gosh okay i think that might have topped even my experience because i think i maybe did 225 one day yeah we were doing uh you know the normal around the world the the standard is four hours of doing these visa interviews each day and then you know it's really busy sometimes they might up to five or even six uh during the height the boss is staring over your shoulder saying go go move them through move them through some people are bold some people are conservative right really cautious they really don't want to issue a visa to someone and then it turned out that they use the visa wrong other people like you and me really want to make sure that people who deserve to get the visa don't get refused unnecessarily right um but really it's just all up to the discretion of that one officer they they get broad authority to make whatever decision they want in that you know what are some things that surprised you about your time you know behind that visa window i think that at the beginning i wasn't i wasn't surprised surprised at the beginning right i came in everything was new it was just learning a new job and it took a little while maybe six months before i realized the real human impact that the job had right you come in and you're learning this new job your colleagues are trying to teach you things you're you know you're learning this new computer system you're trying take a completely separate path right so it's really a huge impact on on people's lives that that that two minutes at a visa interview can can determine um which is why we want to do this podcast right mandy like we're starting this podcast because it's not been done before there are there are a limited number of people probably in the it's more than the hundreds but in the low thousands of people who have who have done visa interviews um who know what's going on behind the visa window worried about what's going to happen during that interview if you've got a family member who's been refused abroad and you don't know why they've been refused if you're an immigration attorney who's got clients who who are running into problems during their visa stamping and you don't know why because it's they go in there and it's a black box they come out with a refusal slip and no explanation you know mandy you're as an immigration attorney i'm sure i'm sure you've run into that a lot once or just a few times in their lives hopefully uh you know fewer rather than more and then it's the visa officer who does this day in and day out so i feel like we have sort of aggregated this amount of expertise just based on the sheer volume of cases that we've seen the people that we have talked to the internal meetings that we have had week after week to make sure that our standards are consistent and these are all things that we hope to share with you our audience uh in the weeks and months to come as we you know embark on could become a liability could seem you know to suggest to the officer that your uh intentions are different than what you're saying and so you never really know what you're conveying unless you really prepare with somebody who knows um exactly what this process entails yeah well many i think now is a good time for you to introduce argo visa to our audience and then i'll let them know afterwards how they can contact us thanks so much ben so argo visa is really a labor of love and dedication to this canada i mean we have worked in 34 countries we speak 14 different languages and i actually counted up all of our years of experience once and i think we have something like nine decades of experience if you were to add it all together wow um and you can find out more information about us at www.argovisa. experiences with it write to us at hello at argovisa.com and each week we'll be talking about some of the the questions and the concerns that come into us and because we've got you know this this great group of former consular officers that we work with you know we'll bring them on when they have particular expertise in the country where you come from or with the visa type that you're applying for and we'll bring them on and we'll have a conversation\"\nVideo Summary:", "length": 3250}
{"prompt": "Below is the payment determinzation algotrhism for an healthcare alternative payment model. I need you to write Stata code to create a dataset with simulated ACR, UAMCC, and DAH measure scores. the ACR measure has 1010 observations, following a normal distribution ranging from 14 to 17; the UAMCC measure has 1005 observations, following a uniform distribution ranging from 45 to 85; the DAH measure has 1000 observations, ranging from 250 to 350 following a normal distribution. The variable that captures unique healthcare org ID is DCE\\_ID. Please make sure none of the DCE has all the three measure scores missing. Then create a Stata code to apply to this simulated dataset, to compute the Final Earn-Back Rate for every DCE. If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1.", "length": 3084}

Tries 20 Jobs | WIRED - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"I'm a lawyer copywriter Doctor music producer personal trainer software engineer DJ I want to know can AI do my job I'm a software engineer where I work we're always trying to know where can I find the best craft beer please generate the code for a website using HTML CSS and flask that tells me where there's craft beer near me this is just raw code you actually need to run the code somewhere I'm copying pasting the code into separate files and it generates a website how cool here's our website all three pieces the back end the front end and The Styling did actually make something that was human readable that that generates a website that we can look at and understand what it does does seem like a huge feat to me I'm a doctor this prompt is something that a patient might enter I have a fever rash and body aches the rash looks like small welds on my genitals do I have monkey pox the response is pretty solid in the sense that it's unlikely that you have monkey pox the specific thing I got right was that the monkey pox rash is actually not prominent on the genital area it goes on to say that a rash in the general area most likely is an STI the rest of the answer is just fluff talking to your healthcare provider which is pretty obvious can AI do my job I don't think it's there yet I think the AI right now is really good for a first year medical student I'm a graphic designer Rebrand the McDonald's logo as vegan I'm seeing four image variations it's struggling with text it's looking sort of like characters but in some sort of fictional language I wouldn't send any of these straight away to McDonald's they do each need a little bit of work the fourth one I think is maybe the strongest it's leaning towards more organic colors overall I don't think AI can do my job I kind of see this as a more evolved Pinterest I can use it as a base for inspiration but I don't think it will replace me all together or so I hope I'm a therapist people come to me when they want help in dating or relationships please answer the following question in a way a relationship therapist would why do I always fight with my partners conflicts are a natural part of any relationship fighting or arguing is not necessarily a sign of a bad relationship great some possible factors include communication issues stress and life events different conflict styles how do I know what my conflict style is reflect on your past conflicts observe your behavior during conflicts most people are incapable of reflecting on their conflict style during conflicts so while this is great information I'm not sure how actionable it is what AI has done is it's just dumped a bunch of information were I to be a client I would probably want my money back that's just me so can AI do my job I would say have self-help books done my job people don't lack knowledge they lack the ability to follow through I'm a stand-up comedian and I want to know if an AI can do my job write a 100 word minimum funny stand-up comedy joke let me go ahead and perform this and we'll see what we got online dating what a wild ride that is you know what they say swipe right for love and left for well probably just another cat person but hey at least it's better than meeting someone at a bar and realizing you have the same dad again like what side are you using ancestry.com that's a little creepy it has the Cadence right which is what's so fascinating to me and it's kind of creeping me out I did think it was cute when it was like oh swipe left on a cat person although let's be honest that's a little feline phobic I'm not concerned about the AI yet it could take a crappier comedian's job but it can't take mine I'm a lawyer my client is asking me whether or not they can sell someone's health information please write a legal memorandum about this in a true legal memorandum it would give you which sections of the regulation you're talking about which this is not doing it doesn't say what the penalties are is it criminal is it civil I don't really know where it's getting its information I don't know how much I can trust this if it were like a legal associate I would say go back and do a better job I'm a news anchor I want to know if AI can do my job I have given the AEI some text to read a forest fire has blazed through a large part of the Southern mountain region of the country she didn't sound natural he sounded like a machine speaking the lips look weird it looked like the lips did not belong to the face and provide Aid to those affected when I speak I'm moving my hands but I'm also moving some of my body she wasn't doing that I do a newscast in Spanish now let's see how it does with the Spanish newscast on incendio Forrestal ha effectado una Grand Park de la region it sucked in Spanish she actually threw in some Spanglish there miles to Hector is and the accent I have Casado she definitely struggled there the AI cannot take my job for now I'm a bartender surprise me with a Twist on a Negroni and give it a name fill a mixing glass with ice add the Gin Campari and sweet vermouth gently muddle two to three fresh Sage leaves in the glass stir the mixture until well chilled Express the orange peel over the drink release the oils and use it as a garnish there you go you have your Sage Negroni so it's a good classic Negroni I'm not really getting sage just adding the sage leaves was not very creative AI didn't ask me any follow-up questions I would say what do you like is there a style of gin that you like I think if you want to have a truly bespoke cocktail you gotta go see a bartender I'm a screenwriter I'm going to give this AI a prompt that describes a scene in my latest movie and to see how well it can match it in this scene set in 1949 three World War II widows toast their younger sister Ruby's wedding exterior Beach day Mildred Shirley and Charlotte Frolic at the shoreline of the beach and may you never have to experience the Heartbreak that we did the character literally says exactly what like you want the story to do what's going on Ruby seems tense I don't know but I'm going to find out just very on the nose dialogue there's a lot of parentheticals describing how the characters saying the Line This is a screenwriter no no you start to tip into the director's territory I think that AI can help with my my job in conceptual brainstorming playing out scene ideas if you get stuck on a scene but overall I don't think AI can do my job I'm a music producer I'm writing a song for a pop client please write this song and include chords for the guitar the client is heavily influenced by Lana Del Rey it looks like we've gotten a chord structure and some lyrics a typical progression so not too interesting but that's okay so let's make a beat when I work with an artist that's looking for a specific influence I'll think about the BPM that that artist usually goes for [Applause] okay this is pretty good it's a good start another great day in the city I'm feeling lost oh Such a Pity City Lights and heartbeats you walk in and make me complete I like that it's a starting point of course some of the lyrics are super corny I will admit a lot of the time that's how it starts for me right now these programs can't do my job I'm a journalist I'm the reviews editor at wired and I test products for a living so I asked chat gbt to write a review of a product that I've actually written about in the style of my own writing when it comes to electric skateboards there are plenty of options to choose from a little boring this is pulling in data specifically from my review and so it has a lot of similar characteristics and sentences that I might typically use unfortunately I think it's Stripped Away a lot of the personality in the original review it kind of just took a lot of the basic details and spit out this thing that is kind of generic as for things that did right it actually brought out a lot of these specs like the 3000 watt Motors the 26 miles per hour speeds when reading this review it almost sounds like I could have written it by just reading a press release the AI cannot physically handle this product it's not exactly testing the product itself at that point can you really trust where the source is coming from asking chat gbt to write a review based in my voice is definitely weird I'm a circus artist what would I ask the AI to do hmm I don't think there's anything that I can think of that I would have the AI do for me I'm a copywriter McDonald's just went 100 vegan write several taglines so we've got veganize your taste buds today feels like a used car salesman no animals harmed only flavor enhanced I don't ever go to a fast food restaurant and say I really want my flavor enhanced that's not something I'm ever looking for our last one here is wow very short we've got It's Time to Go Green did it run out of um words it typed up some general ideas which actually could help if you were brainstorming and you're like I have nothing at all AI could do my job at a very like a Monday morning no coffee kind of way if you wanted to pay no money and get a bad product sure hey I could do my job I'm a personal trainer please design a fat burning weekly at home workout plan this is definitely a typical plan that someone might want to burn calories with a full body workout you're also doing some type of pull workout that's going to work your back your posterior chain and you're also doing some kind of push so I will say that I like that that it's giving a full range of those types of exercises most people know what a push-up is but do they know how to correctly do a push-up it's saying three sets of eight to ten reps but how much time is in between each set ideally you would want to be able to see the client in person or on a virtual call so that you can see what their form looks like I don't think AI can do my job I'm a DJ I have my radio show coming up I play uplifting disco music for about two hours make a full playlist slash set list for my show it's hitting the Disco on the head for sure I've played a few of these artists on my show before so it's definitely getting pretty close to maybe what a tracklist would be one of these tracks Gotta Keep On by sweet cream I looked it up and there's no trace of it on the internet anywhere where did it get this song from does the song actually exist AI can make a playlist being able to look out into a room and look out into a dance floor and say okay people are tired let me match that energy I don't think that it can do that based on what I've seen I'm a voice actor shouldn't cost the Earth we've created a new line of compostable shoes that are made from sustainable materials I've asked the AI to read this copy let's hear this thing fashion shouldn't cost the Earth we've crew line of compostable hey but not great it's very computer-like it has a strange Cadence and so it ends every sentence like this sustainable which is not the way a human talks it can't change on the Fly is there a joke that I'm supposed to get in the next line it doesn't understand all those things the things that come from like life experiences it's never going to be like the thing that you're going to use for like McDonald's commercials it's going to be like the things that no one really likes to do anyway like 400 hours of instruction manuals or something like that can AI do my job kinda but not really well although it still freaks me out I'm an influencer and I want to know if AI can do my job I want chat gbt to help me with an IG caption that's a picture of me smiling standing at the top of my Matra in Paris Standing On Top of the World or at least on top of mamatra smiley face eyes the view from here is breathtaking the Sakura cord in my back reminding me of the city's Rich history and culture feeling grateful and inspired what a day it has been hashtag grateful this is like really strong but it doesn't necessarily capture how I would speak my audience would know that this is not me probably from the overwhelming amount of emojis I would probably say like hey y'all or like sis that was amazing this AI program cannot do my job but it's very close I'm a chef write a recipe for an Indian restaurant meal include a protein marination it's got definitely a lot of spices that you use in Indian cooking it's actually missing a key component it didn't include yogurt which kind of acts as a binding agent 400 Degrees 20 to 25 minutes for chicken it would probably dry it out overall I would say it's like a nice 8 out of 10 dish I do think a substantial part of being a chef is that creativity and coming up with dishes so in terms of that aspect of the job I think AI comes dangerously close to being able to do my job I'm a translator please translate the opening paragraph of The Sun Also Rises into Korean structural sentence pretty good but there are so many mistakes like if you see the second sentence this is wrong translation in Korean we have casual form and then also respectful form this AI translation use basic written form in first sentence but in the second sentence he used like respect for form it's not consistent AI cannot do my job maybe someday it can do it but so far it's like it made so many mistakes I'm a firefighter there's no way AI can do my job [Music]\"", "length": 3260}

{"prompt": "Can you consolidate this script and reorganize it and remove duplicate ideas? \nJonathan: Hey, Damian, can I talk to you about something?\nDamian: (looking up from his book) What is it?\nJonathan: Well, I was just thinking about how you don't really believe in God or Jesus, right?\nDamian: (rolls his eyes) Of course not. I'm a trained assassin, not some naive believer in fairy tales.\nJonathan: (smiling) That's okay, I used to think the same thing too. But then I started going to church with my parents, and I learned a lot about Jesus.\nDamian: (skeptical) What's so special about Jesus?\nJonathan: Well, Jesus was like a superhero too, in a way. He had amazing powers, but he used them to help people and do good. And he loved everyone, even his enemies.\nDamian: (confused) But why did he have to die on the cross?\nJonathan: That's the really amazing part. Jesus died on the cross to save us from our sins, so that we could be forgiven and have eternal life with God.\nDamian: (still skeptical) But how do you know it's true?\nJonathan: (smiling) That's where faith comes in. It's not something you can prove or see, but you can feel it in your heart. And I know that Jesus is real because I feel his love every day.\nDamian: (pauses, thinking) I don't know if I believe in all that stuff, but I respect your beliefs, John.\nJonathan: (grinning) That's all I can ask for. Maybe one day you'll come to church with me and see for yourself.\nDamian: (smirking) We'll see about that. But thanks for sharing, John.\nDamian: I've been having doubts and fears about myself lately. I know I've done some pretty bad things in the past, and sometimes I wonder if I'm just too wicked to ever be forgiven.\nJonathan: I used to feel the same way, Damian. But then I learned about God's forgiveness, and it gave me hope.\nDamian: (skeptical) Forgiveness? I don't see how that's possible. I've hurt so many people and done things that can't be undone.\nJonathan: I know it seems impossible, but that's what makes God's love so amazing. He forgives us for our sins, no matter how big or small, and he gives us a second chance to make things right.\nDamian: (thoughtful) But how do you know he'll forgive me? I'm not exactly a saint, John.\nJonathan: (smiling) I don't know for sure, but I have faith that he will. And I know he's forgiven me for my own mistakes.\nDamian: (curious) What kind of mistakes did you make?\nJonathan: (hesitates) Well, I used to have anger issues, and I would sometimes lash out at people when I was upset. I even got into a fight once and hurt someone pretty badly.\nDamian: (surprised) You? But you're always so kind and patient.\nJonathan: (laughs) It's taken a lot of hard work to overcome my anger issues, but I couldn't have done it without God's help. He showed me that I didn't have to be controlled by my emotions, and he gave me the strength to change.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. I'm still not sure I believe in all this, but it's good to know that there's hope for people like us.\nJonathan: (smiling) There is always hope, Damian. And I'm here for you, no matter what.\nJonathan: Damian, it's important to understand that it's not about becoming a good person or being fixed overnight. It's about trusting Jesus with your life.\nDamian: (confused) Trusting Jesus? What does that even mean?\nJonathan: It means letting go of your doubts and fears and putting your faith in him. It means admitting that you can't do everything on your own and that you need his help.\nDamian: (skeptical) I don't know if I can do that. I've always relied on my own strength and skills to get by.\nJonathan: I know it's hard to let go of control, but that's where faith comes in. When we trust in Jesus, we're not alone anymore. He walks with us and guides us through every situation.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I see. But what about all the bad things I've done? How can I ever make up for them?\nJonathan: You don't have to make up for them, Damian. That's the beauty of God's forgiveness. When we confess our sins and ask for his forgiveness, he washes them away and remembers them no more.\nDamian: (surprised) Really? It can be that simple?\nJonathan: (nodding) It can, but it's not always easy. It takes courage to admit our faults and ask for help. But when we do, Jesus is there to comfort us and guide us to a better path.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) I think I understand a little better now, John. Maybe one day I'll be able to trust Jesus like you do.\nJonathan: (grinning) I'll be here for you whenever you're ready, Damian. And so will Jesus.\n\nDamian: Hey, John. Can I talk to you about something?\nJonathan: Of course, what's on your mind?\nDamian: I've been having doubts and fears about myself lately. I know I've done some pretty bad things in the past, and sometimes I wonder if I'm just too wicked to ever be forgiven.\nJonathan: I understand how you feel, Damian. I've struggled with those thoughts myself.\nDamian: (surprised) You have?\nJonathan: Yes, I have. There have been times when I've felt like I'm not good enough, like I don't deserve God's forgiveness.\nDamian: (thoughtful) But how do you deal with those feelings?\nJonathan: (pausing) Well, it's not easy. But I try to remember that God's love is unconditional. He doesn't forgive us because we deserve it, but because he loves us.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. But what if I can't change who I am? What if I'm always going to be a bad person?\nJonathan: (hesitates) It's true that we can't change ourselves on our own. But when we trust in Jesus, he can change us from the inside out.\nDamian: (skeptical) How do you know that?\nJonathan: (pausing) Honestly, I don't always know. There are times when I feel like I'm still the same person I was before I started following Jesus. But I also know that I'm not alone in my struggles. And that gives me hope.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I think I understand what you're saying. It's not about being perfect, but about trusting in something bigger than ourselves.\nJonathan: (smiling) Yes, exactly. And I'm here to support you, no matter what you believe.\nDamian: (grinning slightly) Thanks, John. I appreciate that.\nDamian: Hey, John. Can I talk to you about something?\nJonathan: Of course, what's on your mind?\nDamian: I've been having doubts and fears about myself lately. I know I've done some pretty bad things in the past, and sometimes I wonder if I'm just too wicked to ever be forgiven.\nJonathan: I understand how you feel, Damian. I've been there too.\nDamian: (surprised) You have?\nJonathan: Yes, I have. There was a time when I felt like I was beyond hope, like I was just too broken to ever be fixed.\nDamian: (thoughtful) What changed?\nJonathan: (pausing) Well, it wasn't one thing. It was a series of events that made me realize I needed something more in my life.\nDamian: (curious) What kind of events?\nJonathan: (takes a deep breath) My parents got divorced when I was young. That was really hard for me to deal with. And then, when I was a teenager, I got into a car accident that left me with a permanent scar on my face.\nDamian: (surprised) I had no idea. I'm sorry.\nJonathan: (smiling faintly) It's okay. The point is, those experiences made me realize that I needed something bigger than myself to get through life. And that's when I started exploring my faith.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. But what if I'm just too far gone?\nJonathan: (shaking his head) That's not true, Damian. No one is beyond redemption. That's the amazing thing about God's love. It doesn't matter what we've done or how far we've strayed. He still loves us and wants us to come back to him.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet, John. But I appreciate your honesty.\nJonathan: (nodding) I understand. And I'm not trying to pressure you or anything. I just want you to know that you're not alone. We all make mistakes and we all need forgiveness. And I'm here for you, no matter what.\nDamian: (pausing) I appreciate that, John. But I don't know if I can believe in a God who would forgive someone like me.\nJonathan: (gentle) I know it's hard to believe, Damian. But that's what makes God's love so amazing. He doesn't forgive us because we deserve it, but because he loves us. And he's made a way for us to be forgiven, through Jesus.\nDamian: (skeptical) Jesus? The guy who got killed on a cross? I don't see how that helps me.\nJonathan: (smiling faintly) It might not make sense to you right now. But the reason Jesus died on the cross was to take the punishment for our sins, so that we could be forgiven and have eternal life with God.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I guess I can see how that might work. But what about all the terrible things I've done? How can I make up for them?\nJonathan: (pausing) You can't make up for them, Damian. But that's not the point. The point is that God's forgiveness isn't based on our track record. It's based on what Jesus did for us on the cross.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I think I understand what you're saying. It's not about me being good enough, but about Jesus being good enough.\nJonathan: (smiling) Yes, exactly. And that's why we call it grace. It's a free gift that we can't earn or deserve. But when we accept it, it changes everything.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Thanks, John. I needed to hear that. Maybe one day I'll be ready to accept that gift.\nJonathan: (grinning) I'll be here for you when you are, Damian. And so will Jesus.\nDamian: (pausing) I appreciate that, John. But there are things I've done that I'm so ashamed of, I don't know if I could ever be forgiven.\nJonathan: (understanding) I know how you feel, Damian. I used to think the same thing. But then I learned that forgiveness isn't just for the things we've done. It's for the things we've thought, too.\nDamian: (surprised) Thoughts? How can you be forgiven for something you've just thought?\nJonathan: (nodding) It's not just about our actions, Damian. It's about the condition of our hearts. Jesus said that if we even look at someone with lust in our hearts, we've committed adultery. And if we're angry with someone, we've committed murder in our hearts.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I see. But what if you've actually done something terrible?\nJonathan: (pausing) Well, I've done some things I'm not proud of, too. When I was a teenager, I shoplifted from a store and got caught. And then, when I was in college, I cheated on a test and got expelled.\nDamian: (surprised) You did? But you're such a good person now.\nJonathan: (smiling) It's not about me being good, Damian. It's about me being forgiven. When I accepted Jesus as my savior, I realized that his sacrifice on the cross was enough to pay for all my sins, no matter how big or small.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I think I understand what you're saying, John. But what if I'm still not sure about all this?\nJonathan: (gentle) That's okay, Damian. I'm not here to force you to believe anything. I just want you to know that you're not alone, and that there is hope for everyone, no matter what they've done.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Thanks, John. I appreciate that. Maybe one day I'll be able to have faith like you.\nJonathan: (grinning) I believe you will, Damian. And I'll be here to support you, no matter what.", "length": 3357}

He doesn't forgive us because we deserve it, but because he loves us. And he's made a way for us to be forgiven, through Jesus.\nDamian: (skeptical) Jesus? The guy who got killed on a cross? I don't see how that helps me.\nJonathan: (smiling faintly) It might not make sense to you right now. But the reason Jesus died on the cross was to take the punishment for our sins, so that we could be forgiven and have eternal life with God.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I guess I can see how that might work. But what about all the terrible things I've done? How can I make up for them?\nJonathan: (pausing) You can't make up for them, Damian. But that's not the point. The point is that God's forgiveness isn't based on our track record. It's based on what Jesus did for us on the cross.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I think I understand what you're saying. It's not about me being good enough, but about Jesus being good enough.\nJonathan: (smiling) Yes, exactly. And that's why we call it grace. It's a free gift that we can't earn or deserve. But when we accept it, it changes everything.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Thanks, John. I needed to hear that. Maybe one day I'll be ready to accept that gift.\nJonathan: (grinning) I'll be here for you when you are, Damian. And so will Jesus.\nDamian: (pausing) I appreciate that, John. But there are things I've done that I'm so ashamed of, I don't know if I could ever be forgiven.\nJonathan: (understanding) I know how you feel, Damian. I used to think the same thing. But then I learned that forgiveness isn't just for the things we've done. It's for the things we've thought, too.\nDamian: (surprised) Thoughts? How can you be forgiven for something you've just thought?\nJonathan: (nodding) It's not just about our actions, Damian. It's about the condition of our hearts. Jesus said that if we even look at someone with lust in our hearts, we've committed adultery. And if we're angry with someone, we've committed murder in our hearts.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I see. But what if you've actually done something terrible?\nJonathan: (pausing) Well, I've done some things I'm not proud of, too. When I was a teenager, I shoplifted from a store and got caught. And then, when I was in college, I cheated on a test and got expelled.\nDamian: (surprised) You did? But you're such a good person now.\nJonathan: (smiling) It's not about me being good, Damian. It's about me being forgiven. When I accepted Jesus as my savior, I realized that his sacrifice on the cross was enough to pay for all my sins, no matter how big or small.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I think I understand what you're saying, John. But what if I'm still not sure about all this?\nJonathan: (gentle) That's okay, Damian. I'm not here to force you to believe anything. I just want you to know that you're not alone, and that there is hope for everyone, no matter what they've done.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Thanks, John. I appreciate that. Maybe one day I'll be able to have faith like you.\nJonathan: (grinning) I believe you will, Damian. And I'll be here to support you, no matter what.\nDamian: Hey, John. Can I talk to you about something?\nJonathan: (curious) Sure, what's up?\nDamian: (hesitant) I've been feeling really bad about some of the things I've done in the past. I don't think I deserve to be forgiven.\nJonathan: (comforting) I know how you feel, Damian. I've felt that way too.\nDamian: (surprised) You have?\nJonathan: (nodding) Yeah. There was a time when I didn't believe in God, and I did some things I'm not proud of.\nDamian: (thoughtful) Like what?\nJonathan: (hesitant) I used to get into fights at school. And one time, I stole a candy bar from a store.\nDamian: (surprised) You stole something? But you're such a good person now.\nJonathan: (smiling) I'm not perfect, Damian. But I've learned that God's love is bigger than our mistakes. He forgives us when we ask for it, and he helps us become better people.\nDamian: (skeptical) I don't know if I can believe in all that.\nJonathan: (understanding) It's okay if you're not sure yet. But I know that God loves you, and he wants to help you too.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I don't know. There are some things I've done that I don't think I can ever make up for.\nJonathan: (gentle) It's not about making up for things, Damian. It's about trusting God to forgive us, no matter what. That's what Jesus did when he died on the cross for us.\nDamian: (curious) What do you mean?\nJonathan: (explaining) Jesus took the punishment for our sins on himself, so that we could be forgiven and have eternal life with God. It's not something we can earn or deserve. It's a gift.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. But what if I mess up again?\nJonathan: (smiling) It's okay if you do. We all make mistakes. But God is always there to help us\nget back on track.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I guess that makes sense. Thanks, John. I appreciate you talking to me about this.\nJonathan: (grinning) Of course, Damian. I'm always here to talk. And I know that God loves you, no matter what.\nDamian: Hey, John. Can I talk to you about something?\nJonathan: (curious) Sure, what's up?\nDamian: (hesitant) I've been feeling really bad about some of the things I've done in the past. Like when I accidentally unleashed that monster in the city.\nJonathan: (understanding) I remember that. But it wasn't your fault, Damian.\nDamian: (skeptical) But people got hurt because of me. And when I stole the Batmobile and drove it into the river.\nJonathan: (surprised) You stole the Batmobile? That's kind of impressive.\nDamian: (exasperated) That's not the point, John. The point is, I don't think I deserve to be forgiven for what I've done.\nJonathan: (gentle) I know how you feel, Damian. But I believe that God's love is bigger than our mistakes. And He wants to forgive us and help us become better people.\nDamian: (thoughtful) But what if I mess up again? Like when I almost let the Kryptonite kill you.\nJonathan: (smiling) It's okay if you do. We all make mistakes. But the important thing is to keep trying and to keep asking for God's help.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. But how do I know if God's really listening?\nJonathan: (pausing) Well, I don't always know either. But I believe that God is always with us, even when we can't feel Him. And I believe that He loves us, no matter what.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Thanks, John. I appreciate your help.\nJonathan: (grinning) Anytime, Damian. And remember, even heroes need forgiveness sometimes.\nDamian: (in tears) John, I don't think I can do this. I keep having these terrible, sick thoughts that make me feel like a monster.\nJonathan: (concerned) What kind of thoughts, Damian?\nDamian: (ashamed) I don't want to say. They're too awful.\nJonathan: (gentle) It's okay, Damian. You don't have to be afraid to tell me. I won't judge you.\nDamian: (whispering) Sometimes I imagine hurting people. Or worse.\nJonathan: (understanding) I know how you feel, Damian. I've had thoughts like that too.\nDamian: (surprised) You have?\nJonathan: (nodding) Yeah. Sometimes I get angry or jealous or scared, and those thoughts come into my head. But I've learned to take them to God and ask Him for help.\nDamian: (curious) How do you do that?\nJonathan: (explaining) Well, when I'm feeling those things, I try to remember that God loves me and wants to help me. And then I pray and ask Him to take away those thoughts and replace them with good ones.\nDamian: (thoughtful) And it works?\nJonathan: (smiling) Sometimes it takes a while, but it usually does. And even if the thoughts don't go away right away, I know that God still loves me and forgives me.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. That sounds nice. But what if I'm too far gone? What if God can't forgive me for what I've done?\nJonathan: (shaking his head) That's not true, Damian. God's forgiveness isn't based on what we've done, but on what Jesus did for us on the cross. He died for all our sins, even the ones we haven't committed yet.\nDamian: (thoughtful) I think I understand. But it's hard to believe sometimes.\nJonathan: (nodding) I know. But just because it's hard to believe doesn't mean it's not true. And I believe it with all my heart.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Thanks, John. I feel a little better now.\nJonathan: (grinning) Anytime, Damian. Remember, God loves you and wants to help you, no matter what. And I'm here for you too.\nDamian: (nodding and wiping his tears) I believe you, John. Thank you for reminding me of that.\nJonathan: (smiling) You're welcome, Damian. And I'm always here for you if you need to talk.", "length": 3749}
{"prompt": "Please take this script and compress it and reorganize so that it flows better, removing redudant conversation and rewriting it so that it sounds like a 10 year old boy Jonathan and and 13 year old boy Damian are talking to each other (use slang where appropriate): (hesitant) John, there's something I have to tell you. Something terrible that I did.\nJonathan: (concerned) What is it, Damian?\nDamian: (in a low voice) I hurt someone. Really badly. And I don't know if I can ever make it right.\nJonathan: (understanding) I know how you feel, Damian. But the important thing is to repent and ask Jesus to forgive you.\nDamian: (hesitant) I don't know if I can do that, John. I don't even know if I believe in all this.\nJonathan: (gentle) It's okay if you're not sure yet. But I believe that Jesus is the only one who can truly forgive us and heal us. And I believe that He loves you, no matter what.\nDamian: (breaking down in tears) But what if He can't forgive me? What if I'm too far gone?\nJonathan: (comforting) That's not true, Damian. There's no sin too big for Jesus to forgive. He died on the cross for all our sins, so that we could be forgiven and have eternal life with God.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I want to believe that. I really do. But I don't know if I deserve it.\nJonathan: (smiling) That's the thing about grace, Damian. It's a gift that we can't earn or deserve. But when we accept it, it changes everything. And it's not just about forgiveness, it's about being made new.\nDamian: (thoughtful) Being made new?\nJonathan: (explaining) Yeah. When we repent and ask Jesus to forgive us, He doesn't just wipe the slate clean. He also gives us a new heart and a new spirit, so that we can start fresh and live for Him.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. But what if I mess up again? What if I can't live up to His standards?\nJonathan: (gentle) It's okay if you do. We all make mistakes. But that's why we need Jesus. He doesn't just forgive us, He also helps us to live for Him and do the right thing.\nDamian: (nodding) I think I understand. But it's hard to believe sometimes.\nJonathan: (smiling) I know. But I believe it with all my heart. And I believe that Jesus can help you too, Damian.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) Okay, John. I'll try. I'll try to repent and ask for forgiveness.\nJonathan: (grinning) That's the spirit, Damian. And I'll be here for you every step of the way.\nDamian: (in a low voice) John, there's something I have to confess. I did something terrible to my own flesh and blood. I stole something that was very important to them, and I don't know how to make it right.\nJonathan: (concerned) I'm sorry to hear that, Damian. I understand how you feel. There was a time when I didn't tell the truth about something, and it really weighed on me.\nDamian: (curious) What did you do, John?\nJonathan: (hesitant) Well, there was a time when I accidentally broke a vase at my grandma's house. And I was so scared of getting in trouble that I lied and said I didn't do it. But the guilt ate away at me for days.\nDamian: (thoughtful) That sounds rough.\nJonathan: (nodding) It was. But then I remembered what my mom and dad taught me about repentance and asking for forgiveness. So I prayed to God and asked Him to help me tell the truth and make things right.\nDamian: (curious) And what happened?\nJonathan: (smiling) Well, it wasn't easy. But I talked to my grandma and told her the truth, and she forgave me. And I felt so much better afterwards, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. But what if it's something worse? Something that can't be fixed?\nJonathan: (gentle) There's no sin too big for God to forgive, Damian. I believe that with all my heart. And I believe that Jesus can transform our hearts and desires, so that we don't want to sin anymore.\nDamian: (skeptical) But how does that work? How can God change us like that?\nJonathan: (explaining) Well, when we ask Jesus to come into our hearts and be our Lord and Savior, He gives us the Holy Spirit to guide us and help us. And He also gives us a new heart and a new desire to live for Him and do what's right.\nDamian: (thoughtful) That sounds too good to be true.\nJonathan: (smiling) I know it does. But I believe it because I've experienced it myself. When we surrender our lives and our will to God, He can do amazing things in us and through us.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) Okay, John. I think I understand. I'll try to do what's right and ask for forgiveness.\nJonathan: (grinning) That's great, Damian. And I'll be here to support you every step of the way.\nDamian: (shaking his head) I don't know, John. It's not just that one thing. I've done so many terrible things. Like when I hurt my own mother or when I killed Goliath. I don't think I can ever be forgiven for that.\nJonathan: (sympathetic) I know it's hard to believe, Damian. But I still think that God can forgive you. And I still believe that He loves you, no matter what.\nDamian: (doubtful) But how can He? How can He love someone who's so wicked and cruel?\nJonathan: (pausing) I don't know, Damian. But I believe that He does. And I believe that His love is bigger than our mistakes.\nDamian: (breaking down in tears) But what if it's not enough? What if I'm too far gone?\nJonathan: (comforting) That's not true, Damian. God's love is always enough. And there's nothing we can do to earn it or lose it. It's a gift that He freely gives to us, even when we don't deserve it.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I want to believe that. I really do. But it's hard.\nJonathan: (nodding) I know it is. But that's why we need faith. We need to trust in God's promises, even when we don't understand them or feel them.\nDamian: (curious) What promises?\nJonathan: (smiling) Well, for one thing, He promised to never leave us or forsake us. And He promised to give us peace that surpasses all understanding.\nDamian: (thoughtful) Peace?\nJonathan: (explaining) Yeah. Even when we've done terrible things and feel like we don't deserve forgiveness, God can give us a sense of peace and assurance that everything will be okay.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) Okay, John. I'll try to have faith. But I still feel so ashamed and alone.\nJonathan: (sympathetic) I know how you feel, Damian. But you're not alone. I'm here for you. And more importantly, God is here for you too. And He loves you more than you can imagine.\nDamian: (nodding) Okay, John. Thank you for listening and for not judging me.\nJonathan: (grinning) Anytime, Damian. And remember, even when we can't see it or feel it, God's love is always there. Just like when we were stuck in that cave and thought we were alone, but Superboy and Robin came to rescue us.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Yeah, I remember that.\nJonathan: (smiling back) And just like how we had to trust that they would come, even when it seemed impossible, we have to trust that God will come through for us too. And I believe He will, Damian. I really do.\nDamian: (thoughtful) You know, John. Maybe you're right. Maybe God can forgive me and love me, no matter what.\nJonathan: (encouraging) I believe He can, Damian. And I believe that He already has, through Jesus.\nDamian: (curious) What do you mean?\nJonathan: (explaining) Well, when Jesus died on the cross, He took the punishment for all our sins. He paid the price that we couldn't pay, so that we could be forgiven and have eternal life with God.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I see. And all we have to do is believe in Him?\nJonathan: (nodding) That's right. And not just believe, but also surrender our lives and our will to Him. To follow Him and live for Him, no matter what.\nDamian: (thoughtful) That sounds like a big commitment.\nJonathan: (smiling) It is. But it's also the most rewarding thing we can do. To know that we're living for something greater than ourselves. To know that we have a purpose and a hope that goes beyond this world.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I think I'm ready to take that step, John. To believe in Jesus and follow Him.\nJonathan: (grinning) That's amazing, Damian. I'm so happy for you. And I'll be here to support you every step of the way.\nDamian: (smiling faintly) Thank you, John. And thanks for everything. For listening, for being patient, for showing me the way.\nJonathan: (smiling back) Anytime, Damian. That's what friends are for. And I know that God has a great plan for your life, Damian. A plan to use your strengths and your passions to make a difference in the world. A plan to bring you joy and fulfillment, beyond what you can imagine.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I believe it, John. I really do. And I'm excited to see what God has in store for me.\nDamian: (hesitant) There's one more thing, John. One more sin that I need to confess.\nJonathan: (listening) What is it, Damian?\nDamian: (in a low voice) I killed a man, John. A man who was trying to hurt me and my friends. But still, I took his life.\nJonathan: (shocked) That's a heavy burden, Damian. But I still believe that God can forgive you, if you're willing to repent and ask for His forgiveness.\nDamian: (tearful) I am, John. I really am. But I don't know how to pray.\nJonathan: (comforting) It's okay, Damian. I can help you. We can pray together, if you want.\nDamian: (nodding) Please, John. I need your help.\nJonathan: (closing his eyes) Okay, Damian. Let's bow our heads and pray.\nDamian: (sniffling) Thank you, John. Thank you for praying for me.\nJonathan: (smiling) Anytime, Damian. That's what friends do. And I believe that God heard our prayer and that He's already working in your life, Damian. I believe that He's forgiven you and that He's giving you a new start, a fresh beginning.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I believe it too, John. And I'm grateful for your friendship and your faith.\nDamian: (excitedly) John, I don't know how to describe it. It's like something shifted inside of me. I feel...different.\nJonathan: (curious) Different how, Damian?\nDamian: (tearful) Different in a good way. Like, I know that God loves me. I know it in my bones. And it's overwhelming, John. It's like nothing I've ever felt before.\nJonathan: (moved) That's amazing, Damian. I'm so happy for you.\nDamian: (nodding) I just wish I could explain it better. It's like, I was blind but now I see. I was lost but now I'm found. And I know that God has a purpose for my life, John. A purpose that goes beyond my own selfish desires or ambitions.\nJonathan: (smiling) I believe it too, Damian. And I believe that God is already shaping you and changing you, in ways that you can't even imagine.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I know, John. And I'm excited to see where this journey takes me. But I still don't know how to pray.\nJonathan: (encouraging) That's okay, Damian. Prayer doesn't have to be fancy or eloquent. It's just talking to God, from the heart. And I believe that God loves it when we're honest and real with Him.\nDamian: (nodding) I see. But what if I curse or say something wrong?\nJonathan: (smiling) God knows your heart, Damian. And He loves you, just the way you are. Even if you curse or say something wrong. He's not looking for perfection, He's looking for a relationship.\nDamian: (nodding slowly) I understand. Okay, John. I'll give it a try.\nJonathan: (nodding) Great, Damian. And don't worry, I'll be here to guide you if you need it. But I think you'll do great.\nDamian: (closing his eyes) Dear God, it's me, Damian. I don't know if I'm doing this right, but I just want to say thank you. Thank you for loving me, even when I didn't love myself. Thank you for sending your Son, Jesus, to die for me, even when I didn't deserve it. Thank you for giving me a new heart and a new start, even when I felt hopeless and lost. I don't know where this journey will take me, but I know that you're with me, every step of the way. And I trust in your promise to guide me and shape me, to make me into the person you created me to be. I'm not perfect, God. I curse and say stupid things sometimes. But I know that you still love me, just the way I am. And I want to live for you, from this day forward. To follow your will and your ways, no matter what. Thank you, God, for hearing my prayer. I love you. In Jesus' name, amen.\nJonathan: (smiling) That was beautiful, Damian. And don't worry about the cursing or the mistakes. God hears your heart, and He loves you, just the way you are.\nDamian: (smiling back) Thank you, John. And thank you for being here for me, every step of the way. You're a true friend, and I'm lucky to have you.", "length": 3775}
{"prompt": "Summarize the following.\nTitle: \"How to become 37.78 times better at anything | Atomic Habits summary (by James Clear) - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"Do you ever feel like you're just floating through\u00a0\u00a0 life...but not actually getting closer\u00a0 to the person that you want to be. It usually happens around New years, you imagine\u00a0 all the bad habits your going to break free from,\u00a0\u00a0 and all the good habits you will begin. \u201cThis time it will be different\u201d\u00a0 you say to yourself. This time I\u00a0\u00a0 AM going to do the things that I say I will. Only to end up back where you began shortly\u00a0 after and no closer to what you had envisaged. So the question is, how do you become the person\u00a0 you dream of becoming? How do you break free\u00a0\u00a0 from bad habits and make the habits\u00a0 you desire easier and automatic? Atomic Habits by James Clear\u00a0 answers all these questions. We are going to be doing a detailed visual summary\u00a0 of this book, And dive deep into topics like Habit loops Dopamine spikes\u00a0 Priming your environment Plus heaps more And make sure to stick around until the\u00a0 end of the video where we tie everything\u00a0\u00a0 together from the video and I go step by\u00a0 step through how I've personally been using\u00a0\u00a0 this book with my own habits and how you\u00a0 can start applying it to your own habits. I hope this summary inspires you to go out\u00a0 and grab a copy of the book for yourself\u00a0\u00a0 because this book deserves a\u00a0 space on everyone\u2019s bookshelf! Let\u2019s jump into it Imagine a plane taking off and\u00a0 travelling from New York to Los Angeles.\u00a0\u00a0 Just before takeoff you adjust the\u00a0 plane just slightly by 3 degrees\u00a0\u00a0 o r around 80 inches. If you kept flying in\u00a0 a straight line...You would end up closer\u00a0\u00a0 to Tijuana in Mexico than in your\u00a0 intended destination of Los Angeles. The same goes for our habits.\u00a0 Tiny changes in our habits\u00a0\u00a0 can change the trajectory of our lives\u00a0 in ways that we can\u2019t even notice\u00a0\u00a0 until many years into the future looking back.\u00a0 In both good ways and bad. You are your habits. The Power of Atomic Habits \u201cA slight change in your daily habits can guide\u00a0 your life to a very different destination\u201d. Massive action Vs 1% improvements Far too often, we convince ourselves that massive\u00a0 success is only possible through massive action\u00a0\u00a0 in any goal we are pursuing. We expect\u00a0 ourselves to make some quantum leap or\u00a0\u00a0 momentous improvement that\u00a0 will gain others attention. However it is the tiny improvements,\u00a0 that aren\u2019t even noticeable at first,\u00a0\u00a0 that create incredible change. Let\u2019s look deeper into the Math 1% better every day for a year will\u00a0 compound to nearly 38 times better. 1% worse every day for over a\u00a0 year will bring you close to zero! Your habits can compound against you in the form\u00a0 of things like stress or negative self-talk. Or they can compound for you in\u00a0 the form of things like knowledge,\u00a0\u00a0 productivity, skills and relationships. \u201cSuccess is the product of\u00a0 daily habits\u2014not once-in\u00a0 a lifetime transformations\u201d The Truth About progress When you start any endeavour in your life, here\u00a0 is what we think should happen. Linear progress. Here is what actually happens. Notice\u00a0 this section here. In the beginning,\u00a0\u00a0 small changes in our progress\u00a0 are not even noticeable. James Clear refers to this part of the\u00a0 graph as \u201cthe valley of disappointment\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019ve done so much! Put in so much\u00a0 effort and you can barely see any results!\u00a0\u00a0 This is where most people fail and\u00a0 slip back into their old routines. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding\u00a0 process are delayed so Patience is required. Goals Vs Systems. \u201c FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\u201d A goal is the result you want\u00a0 to accomplish. Systems deal\u00a0\u00a0 with the processes that lead to results. The conventional wisdom suggests that the best\u00a0 way to achieve anything we want in life-getting\u00a0\u00a0 into better shape, building a successful business,\u00a0\u00a0 spending more time with family is\u00a0 to set specific, realistic goals. But if you completely ignored your\u00a0 goals and focused only on your system,\u00a0\u00a0 would you still succeed? The Author argues that you would. Here are some problems with only having goals. Successful and unsuccessful people share the\u00a0\u00a0 same goals, so therefore the goal can not\u00a0 be what differentiates winners from losers. Achieving a goal only changes\u00a0 your life for a moment in time.\u00a0 Goals can create an either-or conflict.\u00a0 Either you achieve the goal and succeed,\u00a0\u00a0 or you don\u2019t and you are a failure. Even if\u00a0 you were making progress in the right direction\u00a0 When you achieve a goal, what do you do after?\u00a0 If your goal was running the local marathon,\u00a0\u00a0 chances are after completing it,\u00a0 your motivation will quickly fade\u00a0\u00a0 and you will just slip back\u00a0 into your old routines. \u201cGoals are good for setting a direction,\u00a0 but systems are best for making progress\u201d A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS The problem with changing your habits is not you.\u00a0 The reason why you repeat the same bad habit for\u00a0\u00a0 so long isn't because you don't want to change,\u00a0 but because you have the wrong system for change. Atomic habits are small routines and behaviors\u00a0 that accumulate to produce incremental positive\u00a0\u00a0 outcomes over time. Big breakthroughs tend to\u00a0 get more attention than small improvements.\u00a0\u00a0 But what really matters are the little\u00a0 daily decisions and actions we take. \u201cJust as atoms are the\u00a0 building blocks of molecules,\u00a0\u00a0 atomic habits are the building\u00a0 blocks of remarkable results\u201d. There are 3 layers to behavior change. The first layer is changing outcomes.The\u00a0 result. Losing that weight, writing that book,\u00a0\u00a0 winning the season. The outcomes are what you get The Second layer is changing\u00a0 your process. What you do.\u00a0\u00a0 The new workout routine,\u00a0 developing a daily reading habit. And the third layer is changing\u00a0 your identity. What you believe. Your worldviews and how you\u00a0 think about yourself and others. Most people focus on the outcomes but\u00a0 the best way to change your habits\u00a0\u00a0 is by focusing on the person you want to\u00a0 become instead of the results you want. The goal isn\u2019t to learn an instrument,\u00a0 it is to become a musician. The goal isn\u2019t to run a marathon,\u00a0 It is to become a runner. When something you want in your\u00a0 life becomes part of your identity,\u00a0\u00a0 that is when your behaviors will naturally change. When you tell yourself and others \u201cI\u2019m a\u00a0 runner\u201d. You want to live up to that identity. Remind yourself Every Time you do a workout, you are an athlete.\u00a0 Every time you write a line\u00a0 of code, you are a coder. Each time you instruct your\u00a0 team, you are a leader. The Habit Loop A habit is when\u00a0\u00a0 something has been repeated enough\u00a0 times that it becomes automatic.\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately we want our habits to solve problems\u00a0 in our lives with the least amount of effort. A habit is formed and reinforced by\u00a0 means of a continuous feedback loop:\u00a0\u00a0 Cue + Craving + Response + Reward. The key to creating habits that stick\u00a0\u00a0 is to create feedback loops that\u00a0 are continuously being improved. Cue. Phone buzz. Craving.\u00a0 Want to know who messaged.\u00a0\u00a0 Response. Pick up phone. Reward.\u00a0 Solve the problem of who messaged. Cue. Mind goes blank at work. Craving.\u00a0 Want to alleviate the frustration.\u00a0\u00a0 Response. Check social media. Reward. Satisfied the need to feel less frustrated Over time, rewards become associated with cues. So, in this example, checking social media\u00a0 becomes tied to your mind going blank at work. And then checking Facebook may be the cue to check\u00a0 Instagram, which becomes the cue to check YouTube. And before you know it, your mind going blank\u00a0 cue has led to 20 minutes of wasted time. And you more you repeat these habit loops,\u00a0 the stronger and more automatic they become. Cues can really be anything. A smell, a\u00a0 sound a sight, a person, a location etc. Try to think of any cues in your daily life that\u00a0 are initiating your good or bad habit loops. So how can we influence the\u00a0 habit loop to work for us? This book shows us the 4 laws that\u00a0 will guide us to do just that. Law 1 Make it obvious Most of your current habits are so automatic that\u00a0 you don\u2019t even realize them. You must first become\u00a0\u00a0 aware of your habits before you can change them.\u00a0 You can achieve that with your Habit Scorecard. Write down all your daily\u00a0 behaviors on a habits scorecard,\u00a0\u00a0 from the moment you wake up\u00a0 until the moment you go to bed. Your scorecard may look something like this. Based on whether it helps you\u00a0 become the person you aspire to be,\u00a0\u00a0 c The most common cues\u2014time and\u00a0 location\u2014will help you achieve your goals.\u00a0\u00a0 Clearly state your intention to\u00a0 act using the following formula: I will behavior at time in this location. Here is a bad example, \u201cI will read more this month\u201d Here is a good example \u201cI will read a book for 15 minutes\u00a0 daily at 6am in the spare bedroom\u201d. \u201d \u00a0 Creating a habit requires you to redesign\u00a0 the space around you (home/work) to\u00a0 1 - make it easier to see the\u00a0 cues for the desired habits and\u00a0 2 - avert bad habits by making them invisible. If you want to drink more water, make the cues\u00a0 visible and obvious. Place water bottles around\u00a0\u00a0 the house in places you are likely to see them. For example Put your phone in another room for a few\u00a0 hours if you have trouble getting work done.\u00a0 Put junk food out of sight or remove it from\u00a0 your house if you are trying to lose weight. Law 2 Making it Attractive When we expect to be rewarded, we take\u00a0 action. The more rewarding an action is,\u00a0\u00a0 the more likely we are to repeat\u00a0 it until it becomes a habit. Sometimes the thinking and anticipation of the\u00a0 vacation is better than the actual vacation. Seeing the junk food you desire\u00a0 surges dopamine, not after eating it.\u00a0 Drug addicts increase dopamine when they\u00a0 see the drugs, not after taking them. The craving is what causes us to\u00a0 take action in the first place. \u201d We are influenced by the people closest\u00a0 to us, and the groups we belong to. If you are trying to build a new habit,\u00a0 one of the best ways to reinforce the habit\u00a0\u00a0 is to find and become part of a\u00a0 culture where that habit is the norm. If you want to get into better shape,\u00a0 surround yourself with fit people. Reducing uncertainty, there\u2019s Google for that.\u00a0 Seeking social acceptance, there is Instagram. Reprogramming your brain to enjoy hard habits \u201cYou can make hard habits more attractive if you\u00a0\u00a0 can learn to associate them\u00a0 with a positive experience.\u201d By highlighting the benefits of a\u00a0 habit rather than its downsides,\u00a0\u00a0 you can quickly reprogram your mind and\u00a0 make it seem more appealing. So framing habit\u00a0\u00a0 formation in terms of time is flawed. It should\u00a0 be framed in terms of the number of repetitions. Reducing Friction : The Law of Least Effort The more energy required, the less likely it is\u00a0 to happen. It takes almost no energy to get into\u00a0\u00a0 the habit of reading one page of a book each\u00a0 day. Find a simple, 2-minute version of your desired\u00a0\u00a0 habit. You want to scale down your desired\u00a0 outcome. Running a marathon becomes putting\u00a0\u00a0 on your shoes and stretching for 2 minutes.\u00a0 Reading an hour per day becomes reading one\u00a0\u00a0 page. You need to get the routine anchored in\u00a0 place and then slowly build up the difficulty. After you have mastered the 2-minute\u00a0 habit, you can progress to the next phase; To make something more difficult,\u00a0\u00a0 think about ways you can create barriers of\u00a0 friction between yourself and the bad habit. It is the opposite with good habits:\u00a0\u00a0 the immediate result is unpleasant,\u00a0 but the ultimate outcome is satisfying. A certain amount of success in\u00a0 just about every field involves\u00a0\u00a0 ignoring an immediate reward for a long-term one. It is best to add a little immediate pleasure\u00a0 to the habits that will pay off in the long run\u00a0\u00a0 and a little pain to those that won't. When you're having a bad day, you don't\u00a0 realize how valuable it is to just show up. \u201cLost days hurt you more than\u00a0 successful days help you.\u201d Don\u2019t break the chain of continuity. Missing twice\u00a0 is the start of a bad habit; never do it. On a bad\u00a0\u00a0 day, it's better to do 10 sit ups (instead\u00a0 of your normal 50) than not do them at all. So i\u2019m going to try and visually\u00a0 represent how I have personally\u00a0\u00a0 been using this book to build systems\u00a0 around my habits the past few months.\u00a0\u00a0 After you read the book maybe your approach will\u00a0 be different than mine or better, or maybe there\u00a0\u00a0 are some parts I completely missed or could\u00a0 improve upon so do let me know in the comments. Next, I moved on to the craving phase. To increase dopamine and motivation I\u00a0 bundle the workout with listening to\u00a0\u00a0 some of my favorite podcasts. I also implement\u00a0 reprogramming my brain. I tell myself repeatedly\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t \u201chave to do a workout\u201d but that \u201c I\u00a0 get to build strength and a healthier body\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 That subtle shift in mindset has gone a long way. To decrease friction, I made the rule\u00a0 that I\u2019m not allowed to check my phone\u00a0\u00a0 until the workout was complete. If I get\u00a0 distracted by emails or social media,\u00a0\u00a0 It is one excuse and one step of friction\u00a0 between myself and the workout getting completed. Lastly, this was a game changer for me,\u00a0 priming the environment. I also remind myself that I need to\u00a0 be patient for results and that I\u2019m\u00a0\u00a0 probably still somewhere in this Valley of\u00a0 disappointment before I will see results! So that is my personal\u00a0 system for morning workouts. I went through the same process with the\u00a0 reading habit, with a few minor changes. I used the habit stack. Telling myself\u00a0 things like\u2026 \u2026 consuming is the easy and\u00a0\u00a0 lazy option of the masses ,producing\u00a0 things is difficult but rewarding. Do I\u00a0\u00a0 want to be a consumer or a producer? Random\u00a0 scrolling through feeds is for losers. So\u00a0\u00a0 try to paint your bad habit in a light that\u00a0 makes it super unattractive to keep doing. To increase friction, I left my phone out of\u00a0 sight whilst working in a drawer in another room.\"", "length": 3335}
{"prompt": "Rephrase this article into a very unique 2000 words article about LeBron James passes Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to set NBA\u2019s all-time scoring record\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James became the NBA's all-time leading scorer on Tuesday. \nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James unseated Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer Tuesday, breaking a record that was once thought untouchable by hitting a fadeaway jumper from the top of the key late in the third quarter of a 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. For James, a four-time NBA champion, a four-time MVP and a four-time Finals MVP, passing Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s hallowed record of 38,387 points reflects an unmatched standard of consistency and scoring prowess across 20 seasons.\nWith less than 15 seconds remaining in the third quarter, James backed down on Thunder forward Kenrich Williams at the left elbow and worked his way across the paint. After bumping Williams to create space, James faded away and to his left, holding his follow-through as his jumper swished through to a loud ovation.\n\u201cI was able to get to a really good spot on the floor, where I\u2019m very comfortable, and get to one of my patented fadeaway shots,\u201d James said. \u201cA lot of people wanted me to go to the skyhook to break the record, or one of my signature dunks. But my fadeaway is a signature play as well. I was able to get it, and it touched nothing but the bottom of the net.\u201d\n\nJames then jogged down the court, raising both of his arms in celebration. The officials stopped the game for a brief ceremony with 10.9 seconds remaining in the period, as a video tribute played on the jumbotron recognizing big moments from James\u2019s career, including his titles with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and Lakers. James was joined on the court by his family, Abdul-Jabbar and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for a presentation of the game ball.\n\n\u201cA record that has stood for nearly 40 years, which, Kareem, many people thought would never be broken,\u201d Silver said. \u201cLeBron, you are the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring leader.\u201d\nLater, in a statement, Silver saluted James\u2019s \u201ctowering achievement,\u201d adding that \"quite amazingly, LeBron continues to play at an elite level and his basketball history is still being written.\u201d\n\nBefore giving a brief speech, James choked back tears and posed for photos with Silver and Abdul-Jabbar, who held up a single finger in recognition of the achievement.\n\n\u201cTo be in the presence of a legend as great as Kareem means so much to me,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling. Please give a standing ovation to the Captain.\u201d\n\nJames then thanked his family, friends and \u201ceveryone who has been a part of this run\u201d for the past two decades.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be me without y\u2019all,\u201d James said. \u201cAll your help, your passion and your sacrifice has helped me get to this point. To the NBA, to Adam Silver, to the late, great David Stern, I thank you guys for allowing me to be a part of something I\u2019ve always dreamed about. I never, ever in a million years would have dreamt this even better than what it is tonight.\u201d\nJames finished with 38 points, seven rebounds and three assists, shooting 13 for 20 from the field, 4 for 6 on three-pointers and 8 for 10 from the free throw line.\n\nThe milestone moment, which came at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles in front of a sellout crowd that repeatedly chanted \u201cM-V-P\u201d as he closed in on the record, was preceded by months of anticipation during an otherwise underwhelming Lakers campaign. James opened the season at media day in September saying he was \u201cin awe\u201d of the scoring record, and his chase of Abdul-Jabbar has been tracked on a game-by-game basis for weeks.\n\nWith James needing just 36 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar entering Tuesday, two courtside seats were listed on Ticketmaster for $75,000 each in the hours before tip-off. Meanwhile, the Lakers issued more than 200 media credentials, a season-high and roughly triple the typical amount, and they deployed large video boards adjacent to the jumbotron to track James\u2019s real-time progress relative to Abdul-Jabbar. At a hotel across from the arena, a large billboard bore James\u2019s image and an appropriate tagline for the occasion: \u201cPlay the game. Then change it forever.\u201d\nBasketball royalty and A-list Hollywood celebrities dotted the crowd. Abdul-Jabbar sat in a baseline courtside seat near the Lakers\u2019 bench, while Silver was joined by a cadre of league office employees on hand to recognize the historic achievement. In an homage to his target, James spent a few minutes working on his own version of Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s signature skyhook during his pregame warmup.\n\nHow the NBA scoring record evolved from Wilt to Kareem to LeBron\n\nActor Denzel Washington, rappers Jay-Z and Bad Bunny, boxer Floyd Mayweather, Nike co-founder Phil Knight, sports commentator Shannon Sharpe, former NBA stars Dwyane Wade and Vince Carter, Dallas Mavericks General Manager Nico Harrison and former Lakers players Magic Johnson, Bob McAdoo, James Worthy and A.C. Green were all in attendance, as were James\u2019s longtime business associates, Rich Paul and Maverick Carter. James\u2019s mother, Gloria, wife, Savannah, and children Bronny, Bryce and Zhuri turned the evening into a family affair. Jim Gray, the host of James\u2019s polarizing \u201cDecision\u201d free agency special in 2010, also mingled courtside before the game.\n\nPerhaps fueled by what he told ESPN was his \u201cdisappointment\u201d over the Lakers\u2019 inability to trade for former teammate Kyrie Irving, or simply a desire to end the circus that has developed around his chase, James came out unusually aggressive, attempting his first shot on the game\u2019s opening possession, scoring eight points in the first quarter, tallying 20 by halftime and breaking the record before the fourth quarter. His every shot was greeted with excited shouts from the crowd, and each made basket drew loud cheers.\n\nJames surpassed Abdul-Jabbar in fewer games (1,410 to 1,560), with a higher scoring average (27.2 points per game to 24.6) and at a younger age (38 to 42).\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar stands on court with LeBron James after James passed Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer, surpassing Abdul-Jabbar's career total of 38,387 points. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nOf course, James had the benefit of a head start by entering the NBA straight out of high school in 2003 at 18; Abdul-Jabbar spent four years at UCLA and debuted at 22. And after opponents such as the San Antonio Spurs famously dared him to shoot from the outside early in his career, James transformed himself into a reliable three-point shooter, thereby giving him another major edge. The NBA didn\u2019t incorporate the three-point line until 1979-80 \u2014 Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s 11th season \u2014 and the 7-foot-2 center made just one three-pointer during his career. The 6-9 James, by contrast, has connected on more than 2,200 three-pointers and counting.\nAbdul-Jabbar, 75, had been the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer for more than 38 years. On April 5, 1984, he took a pass from Johnson and sank a skyhook against the Utah Jazz to surpass Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s career total of 31,419 points. Less than nine months later, James was born in Akron, Ohio.\n\nFive truly unbreakable NBA records now that LeBron has passed Kareem\n\n\u201c[James] got out of high school, he had the size and the talent to step right into the NBA, and he immediately started to have his effect,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said in a postgame interview. \u201cThat\u2019s gone for almost 20 years now. You\u2019ve got to give him credit for just the way he planned to last and to dominate. He led teams to [four] world championships, and they didn\u2019t get there because of someone else. LeBron led them. He has that indefinable essence that they call leadership.\u201d\n\nHall of Fame forward Karl Malone had previously come closest to threatening Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s record, retiring with 36,928 points in 2004. Kobe Bryant (33,643) and Michael Jordan (32,292) retired as top-five scorers but never seriously threatened the top spot. Remarkably, the closest active NBA player to James\u2019s total is Brooklyn Nets star Kevin Durant, 34, who ranks 14th all-time with 26,684 points.\nPitched by scouts as a blend of Jordan and Johnson when he was a teenager, James has long prided himself on his ability to balance scoring and playmaking throughout his career, regularly stating that he tries to \u201cplay the right way\u201d rather than pad his own scoring numbers. Proving those lofty pre-draft expectations to be prescient, James now ranks first all-time in scoring and fourth all-time in assists, trailing only John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul. James is also the all-time postseason scoring leader with 7,631 points, topping Jordan (5,987), Abdul-Jabbar (5,762) and Bryant (5,640).\n\nLike Abdul-Jabbar, who led the NBA in scoring in his second and third season but never again, James arrived at the summit thanks to constant progress and durability. James\u2019s only scoring title came in 2007-08, while Jordan won 10 and Chamberlain claimed seven. Yet James has averaged at least 20 points per game in all 20 of his seasons \u2014 and at least 25 points in the past 19.\nLeBron James throws chalk in the air before taking the court for the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Oklahoma City Thunder at Crypto.com Arena on Tuesday in Los Angeles. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\nMore prolific scorers such as Jordan, who retired twice in the middle of his career, and Chamberlain, who called it quits after 14 seasons, proved incapable of matching James\u2019s longevity. As such, James has made steady progress up the all-time scoring charts, passing Chamberlain in November 2018, Jordan in March 2019, Bryant in January 2020 and Malone in March 2022.\n\nCase in points: LeBron and Kareem will finally share a bond\n\nIn contrast to Abdul-Jabbar, who dominated the paint thanks to his unmatched skyhook, James isn\u2019t typically associated with one trademark move. Early in his career, his highflying transition dunks and chase-down blocks garnered most of the attention. As he aged, James worked to extend his shooting range beyond the arc and to improve his midrange turnaround jumper. In recent years, James has become even more reliant on the three-pointer, adding a look-away and sidestep combination that helps him generate cleaner looks.\nShortly after the game, a relieved and exuberant James shook hands with Abdul-Jabbar, took pictures with his family and watched a video of his record-setting shot filmed by his son, Bronny.\n\nDuring a postgame news conference in a room that had been rearranged to accommodate a standing room only horde of media members, James sat beside the game ball, which was decorated with a purple crown. He told reporters that he had \u201cdressed for the occasion\u201d with a sharp black suit and black dress shirt, and that he had donned a white headband during the game as a nod to his early days.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has really hit me on what just transpired,\u201d James said. \u201cAs much as I try to live in the moment, it\u2019s kind of a blur.\u201d\n\nGiven that James is under contract through the 2024-25 season and said recently that he is \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d and plans to play \u201cat least a few more years,\u201d he is on track to become the first NBA player to score 40,000 points \u2014 and he could exceed that threshold by a considerable margin.\nBefore James exited the arena, weaving through dozens of well-wishers, he was asked how the scoring record might impact the \u201cGreatest Of All Time\u201d debates that pit him against Jordan, Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell and other legends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great barbershop talk,\" James said. \"It\u2019s going to happen forever and ever. If I was the GM, or whatever the case may be, of a franchise that was starting up, and I had the No. 1 pick, I\u2019d take me.\u201d", "length": 3199}
{"prompt": "Can you comment on the following RFC?\n:wave: Hey,\n\nI've been thinking about how to implement SIMD operations on the RISC-V backend. These are sort of my notes / thoughts about this. Hopefully I haven't missed something too big that invalidates all of this.\n\nFeedback would be appreciated! \n\n# RISC-V Vector Intro\n\nThis is a small introduction to the Vector Extensions in case people aren't familiar with it.\n\n\\* In RISC-V we have 32 vector registers.\n\\* These registers have \\*some\\* uarch specific size.\n \\* This can be queried at run time\n\\* Each vector register has a minimum of 32bits (The maximum is 64KiB :eyes:).\n \\* The minimum for Application Processors is 128 bits\n\\* It can process elements of size 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits\n \\* Element size is part of architectural state and not each explicit in each instruction\n \\* So, we have a generic `add` instruction that is both `add.i32` and `add.i64` depending on how the hardware is currently configured\n\\* If necessary we can group multiple registers to get a larger register\n \\* If we have 32 x 128bit registers, we can use them as 16 x 256bit registers instead\n \\* This is also part of architectural state and not defined in each instruction\n \\* We probably won't use this, but its a cool trick\n\\* Hardware is configured using the `vset{i}vl{i}` instruction\n \\* I'm mention it here, because I use that instruction name a few times in the rest of the document\n\\* Masking is supported\n \\* We have one mask register (v0)\n \\* The mask register has double use as both a regular vector register and a mask register\n \\* I don't think we will use masking anywhere in this proposal\n \\* Maybe for some weird SIMD instruction?\n\nI like this [blog post that explains how this all works in a much better way][rvv-intro-blog].\n\n# 1. Planned implementation\n\nWith some careful orchestration we can operate the Vector hardware for fixed width SIMD operations.\n\nThe general idea is that we can emulate a `iadd.i32x4` by emitting the following code:\n```asm\nvsetivli zero, 4, e32, m1, ta, ma\nvadd.vv v0, v1, v2\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of that:\n```asm\nvsetivli ;; This instruction configures the vector hardware\n zero, ;; Ignore the amount of processed elements. (We know that we can process them all in one go)\n 4, ;; Process at most 4 elements\n e32, ;; Each element is 32 bits\n m1, ;; Do not group registers\n ta, ;; Tail-Agnostic Mode (The rest of the register past 128bits is left undefined)\n ma ;; Mask-Agnostic Mode (Similar to ta but for the mask register)\n\nvadd.vv ;; Vector Add (Vector-Vector)\n v0, ;; Store the results in v0 (It is a usable register for vectors unlike x0)\n v1, ;; LHS is the v1 register\n v2 ;; RHS is the v2 register\n```\n\n`vsetivli` has an output register that saves the amount of elements it can do, but since we know that all processors support a minimum of 128bits per vector register we have a guarantee that all elements will be processed by a single instruction and don't need to check the output register. So we set it to the zero register to ignore it. (There are some asterisks here, see [Regalloc fun for small vectors implementations](#2.3.-regalloc-fun-for-small-vectors-implementations) for more details on that!)\n\nWe also only need to reconfigure the vector hardware when we change element-width or element-count. So this CLIF code:\n```\nv0 = fadd.f32x4 v1, v2\nv3 = iadd.i32x4 v4, v5\nv6 = iadd.i64x2 v7, v8\n```\n\nCould be lowered to:\n```asm\nvsetivli zero, 4, e32, m1, ta, ma ;; 4 elements of 32bit size\nvfadd.vv v0, v1, v2\n;; Here we don't actually need to change the hardware despite it being a different CLIF type!\nvadd.vv v3, v4, v5\nvsetivli zero, 2, e64, m1, ta, ma ;; 2 elements of 64bit size\nvadd.vv v6, v7, v8\n```\n\nSwitching vector modes is not done during instruction selection, but on a VCode pass that runs post Instruction Selection.\n\nEach lowered vector instruction carries the full vector configuration that it needs, and in the VCode Pass we insert `vsetvli`'s as necessary (i.e. between instructions with different vector configurations).\n## 1.1 VCode Instructions\n\nThe first step is carrying the full vector configuration in each VCode instruction. Here's how I expect these instructions to look like\n\n```asm\nvfadd.vv v0, v1, v2 #avl=4 #vtype=(e32, m1, ta, ma)\n vadd.vv v3, v4, v5 #avl=4 #vtype=(e32, m1, ta, ma)\n vadd.vv v6, v7, v8 #avl=2 #vtype=(e64, m1, ta, ma)\n```\n\nI've lifted these names out of the ISA spec. \n\n`avl` (Application Vector Length) is the maximum number of elements that we want to process. For this SIMD proposal it's always an immediate with the number of lanes. However for the purposes of VCode it can also be a register, this is required for interoperability with a future dynamic vector implementation.\n\n`vtype` is the rest of the configuration data for the vector hardware.\n\nThere is additional state that I'm ignoring here:\n\\* `vxrm`: Vector fixed-point rounding mode register\n\\* `vxsat`: Vector fixed-point saturation flag register\n\nNot sure if we need these, but we can handle them in the same manner as `vtype`, and insert their respective mode switching instructions in the same pass.\n\nAdditionally each instruction has an optional mask register. When unmasked this does not show up in the assembly, this is handled as a normal register input to each instruction.\n\n## 1.2 The VCode Pass\n\nAfter Instruction Selection (but before Register Allocation!) we need to run a custom VCode pass.\n\nThis pass walks the VCode forwards and keeps track of the \"current\" vector configuration. Whenever a instruction requests a different one we emit a `vsetvli`.\n\nThe reason for this being done Pre-Regalloc is that for the actual dynamic vectors. `avl` is probably not an immediate, but a register with the number of elements that we want to process. So we also need to have that interaction with regalloc. I don't expect to have to do that for SIMD yet, but this pass should probably work for both the current SIMD implementation and a future Dynamic Vectors implementation.\n\nThe current calling convention clobbers the vector configuration on all calls. So we also need to keep track of that and query the ABI layer.\n\nA neat idea to further optimize this is by inheriting the vector configuration if all the dominator blocks to the current block end in the same vector configuration. This avoids us having to emit a `vsetvli` on each basic block if the configuration never changes.\n\nA downside of this pass is that we \\*need\\* to run it to get correct codegen. Even if we never emit a vector instruction. I don't know the performance implications of this, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThis approach is quite similar to what LLVM does, see Page 41 of [this presentation][rvv-intro] for more details on that.\n\nSome other ideas in [Alternative ways of emitting `vsetvli`](#2.-alternative-ways-of-emitting-vsetvli)\n\n# 2. Additional considerations\n## 2.1. Spills and Reloads\n\nWe can't do a dynamic sized spill/reload, which is going to be an issue for implementing full dynamic vectors. (See also the discussion here: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/19#issuecomment-998999682)\n\nBut since that isn't implemented yet, and we don't use vector registers for anything else maybe we can do a fixed size 128b store/load for now?\n\nThis is definitely incompatible with a full Dynamic Vector implementation. But for that to work we need to save the full registers and with that the scheme above should still work.\n\n## 2.2. Calling Convention for Vectors\n\nAll registers are Caller-Saved, vl and vtype are also Caller-Saved. \n\nStandard States:\n> Vector registers are not used for passing arguments or return values; we intend to define a new calling convention variant to allow that as a future software optimization.\n\n[Clang does a dynamic stack store and seems to pass everything via stack.](https://godbolt.org/z/T7sMqz4so). This is the same problem as [2.1. Spills and Reloads](#2.1.-spills-and-reloads)\n\n\\* [RISC-V Vector Register Convention][psabi-vector-register-convention]\n\\* [RISC-V ELF psABI (pdf)][psabi]\n\n## 2.3. Regalloc fun for small vectors implementations\n\n(See `\u00a718.1. Zvl\\*: Minimum Vector Length Standard Extensions` of the [V Extension Spec][v-spec-18-1]) \n\nThe minimum vector register width is 32bits. This means that in the worse case we need to group up 4 registers to process a single 128b operation. (This is something you can do with RISC-V Vector hardware, but hopefully we won't have to)\n\nThis affects regalloc since if we compile with a minimum vector register width of 32bits, we effectively only have 8 registers to work with.\n\nThis is a problem because we have to share our regalloc space with the float registers since we don't have space for an additional register class (see: [regalloc2/#47][regalloc2-reg-classes]). This means that we need to have the same number of float registers as vector registers. (At least I'm not seeing any clever regalloc tricks that we can pull off here)\n\nMy solution for this is to ignore `Zvl32b` and `Zvl64b` for now. \n\nAdditionally `\u00a718.3. V: Vector Extension for Application Processors` states: \n\n> The V vector extension requires Zvl128b.\n\nSo it seems like a reasonable expectation that Linux running RISC-V CPU's will have `Zvl128b`, and if this turns out to be untrue we can change regalloc to deal with it.\n\n## 3. Alternative ways of emitting `vsetvli`\n\nThis applies to both the SIMD implementation and future Dynamic Vector implementations so we need to keep that in mind.\n\n### 3.1 Keeping state during instruction selection\n\nIt would be neat if we could query the last set element length during instruction selection, that way we could minimize the amount of emitted `vsetvli` instructions\n\nInstruction selection is done in backwards order, so this seems unfeasable. (If anyone has any ideas here let me know!)\n\n### 3.2 Post-Lowering VCode Delete pass\n\nI'm including this for completeness because it doesen't seem like a great option\n\nTo avoid making the VCode pass mandatory we could emit a `vsetvli` + `inst` pair for every instruction that we lower. That way the initial lowering would be \"correct\", just not great.\n\nAfter that we can have a optional forward VCode Pass that removes redundant `vsetvli` instructions.\n\nThe advantage here is that this pass is optional! If it is slower to run this than emitting (almost) double the instructions we can avoid it when lowering unoptimized code.\n\nI don't like this option very much.\n\n### 3.3 Using the Register allocator somehow?\n\nWhile writing this up I kept thinking, all of this seems awfully similar to a small register allocator. Where `vtype` is an implicit register to each instruction. Can we make this somehow interact with regalloc?\n\nWe're out of regclasses anyway so I didn't consider this option for too long.\n\n[rvv-intro-blog]: https://itnext.io/grokking-risc-v-vector-processing-6afe35f2b5de\n[v-spec]: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/v-spec.adoc\n[v-spec-18-1]: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/blob/master/v-spec.adoc#181-zvl-minimum-vector-length-standard-extensions\n[vcode-immutable]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/73f42bf81716a38dd6b0b586c3b86ac9324ed184/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/vcode.rs#L56\n[regalloc2-reg-classes]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/regalloc2/issues/47\n[c906]: https://www.t-head.cn/product/c906?lang=en\n[rvv-intro]: https://eupilot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RISC-V-VectorExtension-1-1.pdf\n[psabi]: https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/releases/download/v1.0/riscv-abi.pdf\n[psabi-vector-register-convention]: https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#vector-register-convention", "length": 3461}

{"prompt": "!IMPORTANT: Answer only 'Okay' until you reach 'End of paper.'\n\nContext In Korea, universities are in crisis because of a decrease in the school-age population and the Ministry of Education conducts diagnosis every three years. The government has implemented the University Basic Competency Assessment of Korea and provided \ufb01nancial support to universities based on the expected closures (Kim et al., 2020). Because reputation varies depending on the diagnosis results and is the standard for \ufb01nancial support, most universities are preparing for it and improving the basic competencies of universities in the process of improving the results. Private universities, which account for more than 85% of Korean universities, are subject to structural reform and are preparing for diagnosis through consulting. While conducting consulting at three private universities preparing for the diagnosis of basic university competency, we found that they were making tremendous efforts to seek organizational change and succeed like private companies. University organizations, which can be called knowledge-based organizations, can achieve organizational change based on learning organizations and knowledge sharing. Therefore, this study aims to examine the openness to change along with the two outcome variables (learning organization, knowledge sharing). As the drivers of change are external environment transformation and government evaluation, there was a view that the change initiative should be top-down. To change the university organization, it is necessary to understand the relationship between various interest groups. Dee and Leisyte (2017) conducted interviews with academics and students about seminar courses and advising centers for undergraduate students at universities. Quarchioni et al. (2020) systematized knowledge management in higher education institutions and presented a framework through thematic analysis. Despite the tightly coupled organizational characteristics, organizational change openness and willingness are different from each other, and this study examined the effect of individual and organizational differences and \ufb01ts on learning organization and knowledge sharing and highlighted the role of communication. Method Participants and procedures We targeted employees at three private universities for the current research. Each university included in the sample was rated as a \u201cself-improvement university\u201d or a \u201ccapacityenhancing university\u201d in the University Basic Competency Assessment of Korea, aiming for continued innovation and development. We used a four-point Likert scale for the data collection. All measurements were developed in English and back-translated into Korean by three bilingual subject-matter experts with doctorates in the areas of education administration, policy and career technical education. Some measurement scales were modi\ufb01ed to capture the structure of the university and to re\ufb02ect the higher education context. The survey was conducted as part of a university consulting project; faculty and administrative staff participated in the data collection process through an online survey platform. The faculty and staff are involved in a single task force team for consulting, so they are not treated separately. A survey was distributed to a total of 2,074 faculty and staff members from participating universities. A total of 1,085 participants responded, for a response rate of 52.31%. After excluding insincere responses and missing data, such as uniformly repeated responses (e.g. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and intentionally sequential responses (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), a total of 1,015 participants (faculty = 504, staff = 511) was included in the analysis. Of the participants, 49.7% were faculty and 50.3% were administrative staff members. Of the faculty, 24.4% were female and 47.6% had more than 10 years of organizational tenure. Measures Openness to change. Openness to change was measured using six items. From the original scale (Miller et al., 1994), three items were selected to measure individuals\u2019 perception of their openness to change. These three items were also modi\ufb01ed to measure how individuals perceive their organizations\u2019 openness to change. In terms of item reliability, both individual openness (a = 0.75) and organizational openness (a = 0.81) were internally reliable. Organizational communication. To assess organizational communication, we measured the level of communication through individuals\u2019 perceptions of their organization (i.e. an entire organization, university headquarters or department). For the measurements, we restructured and translated the scale to \ufb01t the university context based on the communication satisfaction questionnaire (Downs and Hazen, 1977). Finally, the measure comprised six items (a = 0.87) and was reliable. Learning organization. Learning organization was assessed with the Dimension of the Learning Organization Questionnaire (Yang et al., 2004). Item reliability (a = 0.86) was reliable. Knowledge sharing. To measure individuals\u2019 knowledge sharing, three items (a = 0.75) were adopted from Mura et al. (2013) scale, which represents the extent to which faculty and staff members share their best practices and experiences. Analytical strategies We collected control variables that might in\ufb02uence individuals\u2019 perceptions of knowledge and learning. First, we controlled for age, employment status, university and tenure. However, the results were not changed by including or not the control variables with the values coded for these demographics as dummy variables. Therefore, following guidelines for super\ufb02uous inclusion of control variables (Carlson and Wu, 2012; Vogel et al., 2016), we performed the analysis in the \ufb01nal model without any of these control variables. We measured the levels of individual and organizational openness to change (OOC) for independent variables through individual perceptions. To analyze the concepts of \ufb01t, congruence and incongruence, a quadratic equation including the two independent variables of polynomial regression was calculated and included in the regression model. We performed a moderated polynomial regression analysis using Mplus 8.4 and analyzed the response surface for a three-dimensional graph using OriginPro 2016 (Edwards and Lambert, 2007). Polynomial regression has been suggested as an alternative to the different scores of dependent variables and can be used to study the \ufb01t, congruence and incongruence of various variables. Before calculations, we conducted mean-centering for the moderator and scale-centering for the two independent variables to avoid multicollinearity issues and to interpret accurately. Polynomial regression analysis includes high-order terms, which are the squared and interacted terms of the individual openness to change (IOC) and OOC in this research. An equation considering the control variables was derived based on the concept presented by Edwards and Parry (1993), as follows: Results Table 1 presents the descriptive analysis including means, standard deviations, zero-order correlations and reliabilities among the variables. Moderate and signi\ufb01cant correlations were found among the variables. Additionally, we performed a con\ufb01rmatory factor analysis and most goodness-of-\ufb01t indices for our measurement model met the criteria ( x 2 = 6,819.60, df = 190, TLI = 0.90; CFI = 0.92; RMSEA = 0.07). Because the variables were measured by a single rater without any time interval, we performed Harman\u2019s single-factor test. The explained total variance was 33.64%; therefore, common method bias was not found (Podsakoff et al., 2003). We conducted a path analysis for the polynomial equations, as shown in Table 2. Many existing studies have examined the moderating effect between independent and dependent variables in nonlinear relationships. In this study, the effect of the moderator on congruence and dependent variables was examined based on previous studies (Graham et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2016). H1 predicted that the positive effect on learning organization would be stronger when communication was high. In Step 2, the F-statistic (F = 92.38) was signi\ufb01cant, indicating that communication could have a signi\ufb01cant moderating effect on a learning organization\u2019s interaction with openness to change congruence. To test the characteristics of the surface along the line of congruence, the slope and curvature were obtained at both high and low levels for the moderator. Guided by Cohen et al. (2003), we considered one standard deviation above and below the meancentered communication and entered the data into equation (1). Table 3 shows the estimated values of the slope and the curvatures of the line of congruence and the line of incongruence for the dependent variables, including learning organization and knowledge sharing. Based on the estimated coef\ufb01cients, Figure 2 shows the response surface. At a low level of communication, the slope of the surface along the line of congruence had a signi\ufb01cant positive value not equal to 0 (a 1 = 0.20, 90% CI [0.07, 0.33]). The results indicate the presence of a directional effect, which means that employees perceived a higher level of learning organization when IOC and OOC were high (high IOC and high OOC) compared with at lower levels (low IOC and low OOC). The curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence was estimated to determine whether the \ufb01t effect existed; however, this case was not signi\ufb01cant because the con\ufb01dence interval included zero (a 4 = \u00c00.13, 90% CI [\u00c00.34, 0.10]). This result indicates that there was no curvilinear or \ufb01t effect of learning organization on the line of incongruence when the level of communication was low. At high levels of communication, the slope of the surface along the line of congruence was not signi\ufb01cant (a 1 = 0.16, 90% CI [\u00c00.08, 0.40]), indicating a pattern of results dissimilar to those at low levels of communication. In contrast, the curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence had a negative and signi\ufb01cant value (a 4 = \u00c00.57, 90% CI [\u00c00.87, \u00c00.26]), with an inverted U-shaped curvature along the line of incongruence. This result indicates that learning organization is higher when an individual\u2019s openness to change is aligned with their organization\u2019s openness to change. When communication is high, the mis\ufb01ts and any deviations from the line of congruence could decrease learning organization. In other words, level of learning organization can be expected to be high through the \ufb01t of IOC and OOC under high-communication conditions. The results of this speci\ufb01c pattern support H1. When communication was low, there was no curvilinear effect of openness to change on learning organizations. However, for the condition of high communication, a strong \ufb01t effect on learning organization was observed due to the congruence of the openness to change. H2 predicted that the positive effect on knowledge sharing would be stronger when communication was high. Based on the F-statistic (F = 25.70), communication played a signi\ufb01cant moderating role in the relationship between openness to change incongruence and knowledge sharing. The lower parts of Table 3 and Figure 2 concern knowledge sharing and illustrate the response surface of the results. At low levels of communication, the slope of the surface along the line of incongruence was not signi\ufb01cantly different from 0 (a 3 = 0.19, 90% CI [\u00c00.03, 0.41]), indicating that there was no directional effect between IOC and OOC on knowledge sharing. We can conclude that any mis\ufb01ts of openness, in which individual openness was greater than organizational openness, had no signi\ufb01cant difference on knowledge sharing compared with individuals who perceived that their organization\u2019s openness was greater than their own. The curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence was signi\ufb01cant and positive (a 4 = 0.36, 90% CI [0.11, 0.62]), suggesting that the line of incongruence curved upward (convex). The positive signi\ufb01cant curvature indicates that more knowledge sharing occurred when IOC and OOC showed larger deviation from each other. In other words, when faculty and staff perceived a greater mismatch between openness at the individual and organizational levels, they shared more knowledge in the condition of low communication. These results indicate that the difference in perception between individuals and organizations is a need-supply \ufb01t. If the IOC is higher than that of the organization, knowledge sharing by the individual is more likely. If the organization\u2019s openness to change is higher, knowledge sharing can occur by learning the best practice established at an organization level. In high communication, the slope of the surface along the line of incongruence was signi\ufb01cant and positive (a 3 = 0.60, 90% CI [0.30, 0.92]), indicating a strong directional effect. Faculty and staff whose individual openness was greater than their perception of organizational openness were more likely to share their knowledge compared with faculty and staff who had low levels of individual openness. Therefore, in situations where communication is active, individuals whose openness to change is lower than organizational openness could be poor at sharing knowledge. As communication becomes plentiful, the curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence became non-signi\ufb01cant (a 4 = \u00c00.08, 90% CI [\u00c00.41, 0.25], which indicates that the line of incongruence was no longer curved. The curvilinear effect might have been lost because the linear directional effect was strongly signi\ufb01cant. Thus, as shown in Figure 2, when communication was high, knowledge sharing decreased along the line of incongruence because IOC was lower than OOC. The positive effects of the mis\ufb01t of openness on knowledge sharing were reduced at a high level of communication. Thus, H2 was not supported.", "length": 3239}

{"prompt": "Here is the second part of this paper:\nMethod: analysing the discourse field of a transformation of agriculture\nFollowing the approach of a problem-oriented discourse field analysis (Jahn and Lux 2009), the discourses revolving around SI and agroecology will be examined more closely. A problem-oriented discourse field analysis aims at generating an overview over the discussions held within a specific discourse field (in this case, the transformation of agriculture according to principles of SI or agroecology), distinguishes priority issues, identifies who the actors are that participate in these discussions, how they position themselves within this discourse and last but not least, it tries to find out whether uncertain, contested or missing stocks of knowledge exist.\nAs the introductory part presented in a very condensed form, the particular discourse field is characterised by great complexity. Underlying aspects from different fields (e.g. questions about food security, diet composition, health, environmental concerns, equity, poverty and livelihoods, declining agrobiodiversity, etc.) play key roles. All of these are individual discourse threads which have their own core issue and merge in the overall debate. They would thus present new discourse fields when dealt with in greater depth. In contrast, with the focus on agroecology and SI, \u2018\u2018cross-cutting threads\u2019\u2019 are looked at, as these approaches generally address issues from multiple fields. The aim is to present these two approaches, illustrate who participates in this discourse field and which arguments are generally brought forth in the, at times, heated discussion. Shared views and dissents will be specified and uncertain knowledge identified.\nThis analysis is based on desktop internet research conducted from January to May 2015, using Google. It is made up of scientific articles, reports from international organisations, NGOs, the private sector and philanthropic foundations that focus on agroecology and/or SI. In this process, five publications emerged as key references which are commonly referred to in respective articles and reports, thus building the framework for discussions. Table 1 provides a brief description of these landmark reports that have influenced the debates on SI and agroecology.\nHowever, given the complexity of the subject and the continuously growing number of publications and actors, this analysis by no means represents an exhaustive review of the relevant literature and can only provide an overview of some of the issues currently discussed.\n\u2018\u2018Feed the world sustainably\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018help the world feed itself\u2019\u2019?\nIn the following section, some underlying premises of SI and agroecology will be briefly presented, before focussing on some of the conflicting views in this discourse field.\n\u2018\u2018Feed the world sustainably\u2019\u2019: sustainable intensification\nThe starting point of the SI discourse is that food production needs to increase in order to face the growing demand today and in the future. To do so, given the wide range of environmental challenges and constraints (e.g. increasing competition for land from other human activities, importance of ecological functions of unfarmed land, degradation of vast areas due to unsustainable land management practices, negative effects of agriculture on biodiversity), expanding agricultural land is neither seen as ecologically sound, nor feasible (e.g. FAO 2009a; Godfray et al. 2010; The Royal Society 2009; MEA 2005). SI thus shares many aspects of the agenda of \u2018\u2018land sparing\u2019\u2019 (i.e. raising yields on farmed land to preserve areas for conservation purposes). In short, its underlying premise is to increase agricultural output levels per area unit while reducing natural (e.g. land and water) and synthetic (e.g. fertilisers, pesticides) inputs by using them more efficiently\u2014and consequently decreasing negative environmental impacts stemming from agricultural production.\nThe term SI was initially introduced by Pretty (1997) with regard to smallholder agriculture in Africa. It referred to a wide range of regenerative and resource conserving methods and technologies applied in low-input agricultural systems fostering linkages and material flows within and between farms. Pretty\u2019s research showed that productivity greatly increased while the gradual substitution of external influences with natural processes reduced the impact on the environment. Considering diverse local conditions and the need to adapt to changes, Pretty opted for an open, not too narrow set of practices to achieve agricultural sustainability. His initial approach strongly emphasised agroecological methods, local knowledge and the active participation of smallholder farmers (Pretty 1997).\nIn recent years, the concept of SI has increasingly been discussed after the publication of the Royal Society\u2019s highly influential report \u2018\u2018Reaping the Benefits\u2019\u2019 in 2009, which urged for a sustainable intensification of global agriculture to increase global food production without having damaging effects on societies or the environment (The Royal Society 2009). Its focus thus shifted to a larger scale. As already emphasised by Pretty 1997, Garnett and Godfray (2012) clarify that SI is rather an aspiration of what needs to be achieved, rather than a concise classification of specific production systems. While \u2018\u2018it is still not clear what SI might look like on the ground, how it might differ amongst production systems, in different places, and given different demand trajectories, and how the tradeoffs that inevitably arise, might be balanced\u2019\u2019 (Garnett and Godfray 2012: 8), various approaches meet the criteria (see Box 1).\nBeing so openly framed, SI is subject to a wide range of interpretations and differing conclusions as to its actual objectives\u2014which can have implications for whether emphasis is put on the Sustainable or the Intensification component: perspectives expand on a gradient ranging from a focus on the production-side, targeted on external inputs and technological advances, to a more holistic view. The latter involves the broader food system, acknowledging that food security cannot be achieved by food production alone and there is a growing consensus that issues such as waste, consumption and distribution. need also be\nBox 1 Approaches in SI\nconsidered (Buckwell et al. 2014; Garnett and Godfray 2012). Yet addressing the wider food system is frequently assigned to other disciplines or actors (Buckwell et al. 2014; Loos et al. 2014).\nIt was following the Royal Society\u2019s report that SI has become a policy goal for many national and international institutions and has been endorsed by several other highlevel reports (Garnett and Godfray 2012; Foresight 2011; FAO 2011; IFAD 2012). For proponents, it represents a paradigm shift in agriculture, which \u2018\u2018when effectively implemented and supported, will provide the \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 outcomes required to meet the dual challenges of feeding the world\u2019s population and saving the planet\u2019\u2019 (FAO 2011: 10). In 2009, the FAO adopted \u2018Sustainable Intensification of Crop Production\u2019 as their Strategic Objective A in their Strategic Framework 2010\u20132019, making it \u2018\u2018one of the principal responses to anticipated growing demands for food and other agricultural products\u2019\u2019 for Member States and thus one of the \u2018\u2018major conceptual building blocks of the Organization\u2019s total package of activities\u2019\u2019 (FAO 2009b: 19 ? 1). Apart from international organisations, governments of the UK and the USA advocate SI, as well as agribusiness companies and organisations such as the Agricultural Biotech Council (ABC 2015) and foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates 2009). \u2018\u2018Helping the world feed itself\u2019\u2019\u2014agroecology\nAgroecology is defined as \u2018\u2018the science of applying ecological concepts and principles to the design and management of sustainable food systems\u2019\u2019 (Gliessman 2007). It is described as an environmentally sound coexistence of agriculture and biodiversity in the same area, which aims to improve agricultural systems by mimicking and enhancing natural processes of the ecosystem. With the application of specific principles (see Box 2), beneficial biological interactions and synergies between components of the agroecosystem are generated and made use of De Schutter (2010). Agroecology is based on maintaining a state of equilibrium (homeostasis), the ability of self-regulation and the influence of biodiversity. Its focus is on interactions and the productivity of the overall agricultural system, rather than on individual species (Silici 2014).\n \n \nSI intends to reduce negative externalities while improving yields, therefore all approaches which fulfil this criterion could technically be applied. At this, their suitability is context-dependent and biophysical, social, cultural and economical aspects should be taken into consideration. Examples for approaches include\nNew and conventional techniques to increase water, nutrient and other input efficiencies\nDevelopment of new varieties or breeds of crops, livestock, aquatic organisms; biosciences including genetic modification\nConservation agriculture (reduced tillage/no till, soil cover and soil recovery strategies) Integrated pest management (IPM), agroecological approaches Foresight (2011), The Royal Society (2009), FAO (2015b)\n \nBox 2 Core principles of agroecology\n \nThe term agroecology has different uses and is described as a science, a set of practices and a social movement, focussing largely on smallholder farms in developing countries\nAs a scientific discipline, it presents the application of ecology in agriculture\nAs a social movement, it focuses on the entire food system which indispensably includes the consideration of political ecology and aspects of equity, participation and empowerment, food sovereignty, rural development, local marketing systems\nAs a set of practices, it proposes principles which are universally applicable, their realisation is, however, context-specific (depending on local environmental and socioeconomic conditions). Key practices include\nMaintaining and stabilising soil health, e.g. using green and liquid manure, intercropping, cultivating legumes, mulching and reduced tillage. Nutrients are recycled on the farm, external inputs are greatly reduced/phased out, soil flora and fauna are promoted\nEfficient use of water resources, e.g. by planting cover crops, contour farming and terracing to reduce runoff and erosion and increase infiltration, water harvesting in dry areas, creating micro-habitats\nIncreasing agrobiodiversity to use niches. IPM, agroforestry, integration of crops and livestock (also aquaculture)\nWibbelman et al. (2013), De Schutter (2010), Silici (2014), IAASTD [International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development] (2009)\n \n \nBuilding upon traditional and local knowledge, agroecology is highly knowledge-intensive. It follows a bottomup approach by integrating knowledge from different fields (local, traditional and scientific knowledge from environmental and social sciences) and promoting dissemination through horizontal learning and sharing of experiences, e.g. farmer field schools and farmer-to-farmer networks (Gliessman 2015). Agroecology literature thus mainly focuses on small, highly diversified farms and smallholders, mostly in developing countries, given that the vast number of smallholders and family farmers (1.5 billion, 43 % of which are women) on 350 million small farms (\\1\u201310 ha) contribute considerably to global food production (with 50 % of global agricultural output for domestic use, in Asian and Sub-Saharan countries it amounts to 80 %) (FAO 2012; Altieri and Nicholls 2012).\nUltimately, it is more than a farming practice and encompasses three facets: It is a science, a set of practices and a social movement (see Wezel et al. 2009). Social benefits are considered to manifest in improved livelihoods of farming households as a result of reduced costs (minimisation of the expenses for expensive inputs), increased yields, improved nutrition and empowerment of women (De Schutter 2014). Agroecology is therefore frequently discussed in the context of food security and rural development by smallholder organisations and NGOs and has been included as a key element of food sovereignty (Nye\u00b4leni Declaration 2015). On a global level, it is strongly advocated for by La Via Campesina (LVC), an international coalition of 164 organisations from 73 countries, representing about 200 million peasants, smallholders, landless people, women farmers, indigenous people, migrants and agricultural workers (LVC 2011). In 2013, the movement was recognised by the FAO as \u2018\u2018the most important voice of small food producers worldwide\u2019\u2019 (LVC 2013).\nOne key characteristic of agroecology is its holistic perspective on the entire food system and proponents call for its fundamental change. It goes beyond the mere change in farming practices, but \u2018\u2018needs to see the food system from the standpoint of the distribution of power\u2014among farmers, among the eaters of food, and among all the many other components of the system\u2019\u2019 (Gliessman 2015: 304). Summarising its different characteristics, it is \u2018\u2018now understood as a participatory action and research process that leads to sustainability and resilience, as a movement of change and justice\u2019\u2019 (Gliessman in FAO 2015a).\nParticularly, since the IAASTD emphasised the important role of agroecology for shaping sustainable agriculture, it has increasingly been discussed within the scientific community, intergovernmental bodies (e.g. the Committee on World Food Security and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), UN agencies (e.g. FAO and UNEP) and NGOs (e.g. Oxfam, Friends of the Earth International, LVC). As Pimbert et al. (2014) phrase it, it is becoming a new \u2018\u2018buzzword\u2019\u2019. In 2014, the FAO hosted so far the largest symposium on agroecology for food security with more than 400 participants (FAO 2015a).\nResults and discussion: conflicting views\nBoth proponents of SI and of agroecology share a deep concern for the food insecurity affecting 100s of millions of people and seek ways to improving this situation.\nLikewise, the need to reduce the negative impacts of prevailing agricultural production methods on the environment is emphasised by all. Despite this common ground, the discourse field consists of a wide range of conflicting views regarding the problem framing of food insecurity and contrasting opinions about how this challenge ought to be addressed. In general, the predominant focus of SI on the production-side is in stark contrast to the holistic perspective of agroecology encompassing the broader food system. Nevertheless, it should be noted that there are variations in both lines of thinking. Agroecology does not object to the entire agenda of SI, and SI includes agroecological practices in their proposed agricultural tools. However, disentangling these from their social and political content is what generally leads to objection and heated debates. As Horlings and Marsden (2011: 442) point out, these debates can be seen \u2018\u2018as critical battlegrounds of rival paradigms, with each attempting to claim the ground of sustainable forms of ecological modernization\u2019\u2019.\nFor the present paper, three issues in this discourse field have been selected, which are frequently discussed in respective publications and where opinions differ considerably: the general question whether more food needs to be produced or whether the challenge is of distributive nature, how production can increase its efficiency, and how agroecology can \u2018\u2018scale up\u2019\u2019.", "length": 3776}

This app allows me to brain dump all my tasks into a list and then decide each day which ones to slide into my schedule. I can make todo lists for each work project and not have to write them on a separate calendar. In the paid version, it also syncs to your external calendar events by automatically blocking them in for you. \n\nIt\u2019s reduced my stress because I frequently over fill my day from imagining I can do more. Now I can realistically know what I can do for that day by visually seeing a concrete plan of blocked tasks. It\u2019s so much better than just a list of tasks written into a calendar to fit in around meetings.\n\nAnd if I don\u2019t finish a task that day, it\u2019s easy to add it back into my schedule the next day. I can also see my progress on which tasks I\u2019ve completed. So I can easily count up the hours spent on each project. \n\nI have a hard time estimating how long tasks take and by extending the time block and moving a task to the next day, I\u2019ve been realizing how much I under estimate my time projections. No wonder I always feel behind. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy to extend the time block for a task and move other tasks to a different time block. You can set up time blocks as small as 5 minutes. And you can drag over multiple tasks into one time block. \n\nI also want to add that the user interface is so simple and intuitive to use. It\u2019s great not to feel overwhelmed by features. It also syncs across all Mac devices for the paid version. And there are notifications for each time block. You can test out so many features in the free version. I paid for the premium version to sync my calendar and use over all my devices. The developer also takes feedback of feature requests and improves the app with them. \n\nI feel in command of my work schedule now. Having ADHD and difficulty with time management and with trouble getting started on tasks because my todo list seems overwhelming, it\u2019s been a life saver for me.\"\nEasy to use I\u2019m new to using my phone for calendar and to-do lists and this app makes it a breeze! I haven\u2019t even finished planning out the week yet and i already feel way less overwhelmed!\nGreat App I heard that a better way to get things done more efficiently is to set them out in a time block and that is exactly what this app does. It\u2019s a perfect app to sechedule out your next day while you are in bed and a big stress reliever to have your day thought out! The only complaint I have is that it goes by 30 minuet chunks so anything that will only take less then 30 minuets you have to write out the time on the bar. Other then that this is a great app and I would 100% recommend this app!\nGreat Customer Support!!! Although I was looking for slightly different features, in spite of knowing this the developer helped me with issues I was having. The response was timely and above and beyond. I would definitely recommend.\nI love this app! I feel organized! It has really cool features and it\u2019s amazing! You have to download and see for yourself.\nLove this app! I love this app! Can you make this app for iWatch please?\nLove it so far So far it\u2019s exactly what I was looking for and more. I am excited to keep learning and using it for our homeschool and just for my daily life. I try to live mostly a minimal ish life focused on essentials but I struggle with perfectionism and being very distractible and this is helping\nGreat app from a responsive developer! Great scheduling app with many features. Especially appreciate the existing calendar import\nthe only timeblocking app that works for me i love the features of this app, especially the option to have a split view of your list and your schedule. the app is very intuitive and simple, yet super helpful for people who struggle with time management.\nI LOVE this app! \"This app is so useful to planning my day! It helps me make sure I get everything done I want to get done and helps me keep organized with my time. As a student (high school) this has been really helpful with keeping on top of homework and projects, by setting a specific time aside to do it. Having a visual reminder in the form of a schedule (especially one as organized as this!) is really great in making sure I meet my goals, like exercising more and sleeping on time. I love how you can colour code things and set the time blocks to be 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes. The lists are also good. I use them to keep track of what homework I need to do, and then I can cross it out! It\u2019s also good for grocery lists and such. Repeating tasks, of course, are super useful. I also think that it\u2019s super easy to move tasks around and add new ones. The whole app is really easy to navigate and use and looks great! I would definitely recommend it to everyone! \n\nEven though this app is AMAZING, there are a few thing that I think would make it even better. First, notifications. I would like if you could set up notifications to remind me about specific tasks for like 1 or 5 or 10 minutes before a task. This would help me stay on track. I know there are already notifications for tasks at the time they start but I think having notifications before tasks would also be helpful. Next, I would really like a section where you could set reminders and keep track of events that you couldn\u2019t put on a daily schedule since they\u2019re all day things, like birthdays, holidays, first day of school/work, etc. I would also love if there was a notes section where you could just add notes with random information you need to jot down or even a sort of journal (it would also be great if you could type and use an Apple Pencil to hand write). I also think it would be great to have more options for recurring tasks. I love the option right now of choosing which day(s) to repeat tasks, but I would also love if you could repeats tasks on, say, Saturday every two weeks, or every month. \n\nSorry for the super long review! I really love this app and it\u2019s so great! The things I think would make it better are obviously just suggestions but I hope you consider them! Thanks for an amazing app that really makes me so much more productive!\n\n EDIT: the developer is very responsive and helpful! I sent an email and the response was very timely and helpful!\"\nAlmost Perfect (edited: problem fixed!) This is exactly what I have been looking for. It would be an absolute perfection if I can check off the items as the day progresses.\nLOVE THIS!!! This will truly make my life better! I have downloaded so many calandra and to do lists and this is the only one with these features. Great for setting up a calendar based on todos. I would love features such as selecting multiple scheduled items at once to move or delete. I would also love to replete a task every month.\nAwesome for large homeschooling families As a mom with a large homeschooling family this app is ridiculously helpful to keep everything running smoothly.\nWorks again after I updated my phone \ud83d\ude03 Love this app! Love being able to set time interval to 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes. Repeat feature works great! Love the color selection! I\u2019ve definitely recommended it to others.\nJust what I needed This is exactly what I was looking for in a \u201cTo Do\u201d app. I really enjoy the simplicity of it. Great job!\nFlawless Underrated and overlooked app\nGood job Quite useful. Well designed and effective\nBest time management app I have found This is a great app for planning your day and managing your time (down to 15 min intervals). There are a few additional features I would like though. Emailed support got a VERY speedy and promising response!\nThis one is the best I was looking for something like that for a long time. It made it easy to 1. track my time, 2. manage my tasks, 3. stop wasting time. I would appreciate the opportunity to choose a more neutral color palette or a night mode. Thank you!\nLoving So Far Just started using app. I really like the list feature as I can give label of morning routine, and under that what I need to do. One label is my dogs and their needs. My three meals can list foods which suffice as a grocery list as well. If this works out I will consider paying for the app to keep it going. I would hate to love this then not have it because the developer couldn\u2019t keep it going. I\u2019m old school and love paper agendas but this is so easy to use and color codes for me. I would like a few more list icons, but that\u2019s just me. Please keep this app going!\nThis app is still going strong Actually have been getting things done recently and I needed something to manage my packed routines and lists. Thank you so much. Pls at least keep updating this, keep it alive.\nGreat app but Please make a iphone widget!! Nuff said.\nExtremely simple and practical I am glad I came across this app. It has been so helpful to get me going and get things finished. This app has a huge potential. I really thank the developers to come up with this app. Was really looking for such an app! Thank you!\nAmazing appp! Great for organization! Will definitely will be recommending!\nGreat app! We Stan a great app! This keeps me on schedule on my day to day operations. Thanks for creating such a great app!!!!!\nGreat for School! Great app that includes a a scheduling feature as well as a list feature! 5/5 would reccomend.\nIntuitive & minimalist planning This scheduler is the best I\u2019ve encountered. Having a task list with daily tasks makes it easy to plan your days without wasting time. Calendar sync function makes sure I don\u2019t miss things I\u2019ve added in other calendars. The colors for every event make a minimal app pop and make me happy to look at my schedule. The developer not to mention is super attentive to replies regarding glitches. Everyone should download this app and pay for premium because your life\u2019s schedule is worth it.\nSimplified to Perfection\u2026\u2026. I have dabbled with many organization tools in my career. Always looking to find that \u201cone\u201d App that will sync perfectly with my mind. I will always continue to browse for that perfect App, but TimeFinder has made it very hard to find anything better. It\u2019s so easy to use and it just makes sense! GameChanger for me!\nAmazing/ must have Must have for daily work. Time blocking is a proven method to greater efficiency. Yet, it is difficult to do because of the tools and technology. This app, solves that problem. Amazing app for productivity\nAmazing Service The app is amazing I sent some additional feedback to developers and Luke is the man! On his game constantly improving it. I suggested tasks and subtasks, a journal, a month view and probably a million other things that could make it perfect but excellence takes time and the app is already a home run. I needed a way to time block and track my day in 10 min increments. I noticed how much time I\u2019m not utilizing and this app is excellent for tracking what you are doing right now and how to plan your tomorrow\u2019s out to the very last minute. The time is there we just need to be mindful of how to use that time for productive means rather then waiting for our next task. Thanks Luke!\nJust what my ADHD brain needed \"I\u2019ve been using this app during the free trial period. With my ADHD brain, inability to plan like \u201cnormal\u201d people plan, my intense hate/hate relationship with time, and trying to get a handle on focusing better, I really put this app through its paces. I have already purchased it because it is that good!\n\nThe developer is extremely responsive and has been so very helpful with my questions and feedback on how the app works. I can count on one hand, with fingers left over, on how many developers are actually responding to their users in a timely manner. \n\nThere is a small learning curve, but, to be fair, it could have been due to my brain not working right rather than the app\u2019s fault. But I\u2019m completely in love with this task app. \n\nI\u2019ve been testing multiple apps since July. This is the first one that is made completely for adults with ADHD. It really helps me to see how much I overestimate what I can accomplish in a day while giving me the help to see how much time things really take. Sorry for the long post but I can\u2019t say enough about how this is changing my life.\"\nKenyatta Great app / love it / it\u2019s easy for me to do n I really like that\nThis app This app helped me so much and changed my life\nGreat app, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE Extremely happy!", "length": 3090}

invite you to part three of our ultimate visa journey with former visa officers and today's topic is what not to do at your visa interview so it's morning for me but it's actually evening time for my colleagues uh kat and swati and this is going to be an exciting session for you today because we have a breadth of experience we have cat who has prior experience as a visa officer in china where she worked at the u. s embassy in beijing and then we have swati who has tons of india experience but also she's worked in honduras so both at the u.s embassy and the us consulate so um you know we're kind of from all over the globe it's night time for them it's really early morning for us but it's so nice that we can gather here in this virtual space to help our audience help our subscribers go through this process sometimes i like to refer to the us visa interview process as a test with no instructions and i think it's interesting because you know to americans it's a relatively straightforward process and even then there are problems but for international you know guests for international citizens all of a sudden you know you're coming face to face with a us government official uh perhaps english is not even your native language and all of a sudden you have to you know be prepared to you know handle this interview and while it might be a short interview it's very high stakes it's very important and you've heard us talk about this over and over again on our sessions that you know you want to start off on the right foot you want to make sure you do well on the interview because your visa record is for life um you don't want a refusal to sort of tarnish your record because it could affect future visa categories that you apply for or a green card that you're applying for and so it's very very important that you master this process and this is what we do here at argo we're all former visa officers we've all had years of experience working behind the visa window interviewing you know tons of uh visa applicants and how many how many interviews have you guys done oh gosh uh i've probably done i don't know over 75 000 between my justice and homeland security and state department days in different kinds of categories immigrant visas and non-immigrant visas citizenship everything yeah i'm considered a visa baby so i've done between 10 and 20 000 visas yes but very with very important expertise in china so you know sometimes i think like one interview in china is like i don't know probably five interviews somewhere else um and i think swati brought up a really good point is that you know the us immigration process is actually handled by two different agencies we have the department of homeland security and some agencies fall under that like cbp and ice and then we have the state department who handles all of the visa processing overseas and so sometimes these two agencies don't necessarily communicate uh you know in the best way possible and for someone like swati who has seen it uh on behalf of both agencies she has been a huge asset to argo and our clients because she's able to understand you know what this will look like from the dhs cbp perspective uh what it looks like from the state department perspective so we all sort of bring our own expertise to this process and we also have our own style and i think you know would you guys agree that the visa interview can be a very subjective experience yeah i mean it totally depends right i mean i know a lot of applicants say oh it's it's about luck it's about the mood and stuff like that but it can depend right because the experience of the visa officers really varies uh it could be their first assignment it could be their fifth posting they could be they could have done you know um there may be just beginning in that post or in their journey or they've already done you know 100 interviews a day and so that really depends and plus it's just you know how the visa officer also kind of um adjudicates themselves how they present themselves how they ask the questions how they receive your answers so it is it is really relative you know depending on who you get also i mean we're all trained all visa officers are trained under the same kind of parameters right we all have what we internally call congen which is our consular training but how we apply it can obviously vary it's still under the immigration laws but still yeah yeah absolutely i think that's such a good point swati and you know it's it's why when clients come to us and you know sometimes they'll tell us i had the same exact situation as my classmate and yet my classmate got approved a visa and i didn't and that happens a lot because a lot of it is about how you convey your personal situation to the visa officer some of it you can't control like what kind of mood your visa officer is in you know are they tired have they not had a chance to have lunch you know all of those things but there are a lot of things that you you know as a visa applicant can control uh how well prepared you are you know whether or not you know how to answer certain questions and that is what we help you with here at argo and so you know i i always like to kick off our sessions with probably the most important um the most important question you know as you know kat and swati we've been getting a lot of clients who have had these problems in the past perhaps they've had a prior refusal uh perhaps they've you know been scammed by an opt company and now they've you know they have a visa revocation on their record um so i feel like you know this is going to be really important so for as one of the things that you shouldn't do for your visa interview um you know what is something that these applicants should not do if they've been refused a visa and they go up to the visa officer and they're asked the question you know what has changed since your last visa application two weeks ago so definitely don't answer no nothing that is an automatic well there's nothing really left to talk about right if you've already said that nothing has changed and that couldn't possibly be the case either if you are a good applicant and you have good information chances are you didn't have a chance to present it or the officer didn't ask you the questions and so this is your opportunity now to represent that information so if you start with no nothing has changed that closes every door and every window there's no way to get to recover from that so i would definitely not start with that yeah i couldn't agree more yeah yeah it's really important so keep that in mind because i would say most prior refusal cases you may be asked that at the window because it's a way for officers to be efficient in their work it's really easy to refuse a visa applicant i know it's it's terrifying to hear that but it is sometimes much easier to refuse someone than to take the time to really understand what happened before what has changed now and to approve them and i'm always telling clients like you have to help the visa officer help you you have to make their jobs easier and so if you say no nothing's changed you're making it easier by letting them refuse your visa and that's not what you want to do and you know what would you guys say are some common mistakes that you've seen visa applicants make at the window oh okay so a lot of people you know go especially here in india when i've seen they go p thinking oh i i already have this itinerary i've already made my hotel bookings and flight bookings would you like to see all this kind of stuff and and you don't want to do that actually because you don't know really what the outcome is going to be of your visa interview so you don't want to end up having to you know be in the hole for your flights and hotels and stuff like that we suggest to everybody don't make your plans until after you've gotten your visa so that's you know definitely prepared speech and they will not let the they will not let the officer break in with any questions at all until they are completed this speech so just going back to the whole idea of a visa right some of it is quite subjective and basically you're trying to get the officer to trust you to give you this visa and that you plan to use this visa for the purposes that are set forth in law right so things that you actually need to you need to be responsible with this visa so if you come and you're just you've got the speech and you're just answers and not robotic answers and a lot of times a lot of people also do is especially we see this with student visa applicants you know they uh when you ask them why did you choose this particular university they've basically gone to the website of the university you know and just kind of said oh it's like very you can tell that they've read some you're just kind of saying something that they've memorized from the website and uh or they say you know something about and i was in touch with sincerity will be recognized they will see that you have tried and that you know you are trying one of the things that we that is really difficult i think is that when people are nervous a lot of the words don't come out so just like you approach anything else right practice yeah practice a few things and maybe talk to a few friends in the foreign language so in english in this particular case just so that you're ready and you kind of expect it a little bit so you don't stutter i think that's such a good point cat going to be able to respond um so that's just kind of a practical tip that we have you know make sure that you're not saying immediately right off the bat can i speak english or sorry can i speak chinese or can i speak my native tongue at this visa interview you want to impress the visa officer and show them how prepared you are to be moving your whole life to a different country for two years or four years to do your studies and it doesn't start with answering like that i totally agree uh unless you're really what do you guys think it's it goes case by case i think really but um but generally uh i would lean towards apply together if you're traveling together especially if you're a family you know um because it it kind of makes more sense you know so if your mom dad and the kids are going you know it kind of uh it just makes more sense you know otherwise sometimes the alarm bells can also go off well why is this person not traveling and i know it's tricky for applicants because sometimes they think if they leave this person group i would say for the most part i almost feel like it is not a huge factor if the rest of your case is strong whether you apply together or you know as a family i've had a lot of clients you know not be able to get appointments together um so it's a possibility that that could happen but just keep in mind that um you need to be prepared for the interview because if you're really prepared for the interview then some of these other things won't matter as much like are you applying you know that's not going to get to the real answers and it's amazing how many times the clients don't think that that's even important but i cannot emphasize how important it is you know it's something it can be you may think it's small but it's it's not really like uh i i had a consul with a an applicant who had studied something totally different but her passion was really in cooking and baking and she really wanted to get a degree in you know in the culinary arts and stuff like that so she was having difficulty and she'd been realize how important it is to provide some detail be able to present it in a way that is quick i always think you know if it's gonna take the visa officer multiple questions to get a real substantive answer out of you that is not going to make that's not going to make your visa officer happy they're going to be really cranky they're like oh like it's so hard to get anything it's like pulling teeth to get something out of this and you really want to make the process easy for them you want to establish sort of a be useful in helping you with your case right a lot of times the stuff just seems like a nebulous cloud you have no idea exactly what the officer is asking you are panicking you have no idea what's happening and they ask you this question and you just give them the first answer that's on the tip of your tongue and i gotta say that's that's not a good way to handle that this generally yeah i don't know about you but the thing that's on the tip of my tongue doesn't tend to be the most question and even if it's you know the same fact how should you when should you mention it in what way should you mention it how much information should you get because often times the visa interview is a balancing act you don't want to say too little but you also don't want to say too much you know we talk about the one word response but i've also had you know clients that i've talked to that just word vomit every single time you ask them a question it's just like oh my gosh like they're com you know we're here we're from all over the world so i guess you know in a sense we kind of don't sleep so if it's 3 a.m in the us you know you have resources like swati who's you know in india and kat who's in taiwan and like able to be up and awake and help you you know and i would say try to sign up for a consultation at least two to three weeks before your interview if you're a student i would sign up even earlier if you're someone who's had a visa problem you know maybe you've been our consulates we can kind of help you decipher okay well you maybe want to bring this information up further you know like sooner sorry sooner because you don't know if you're gonna get asked that or um you know it helps your case it's the maybe the change factor that you that you need in your case you want to present it sooner it's the stronger point so i i would just re-emphasize that for sure\"\nVideo Summary:", "length": 3263}

{"prompt": "Title: \"(4) How to ACTUALLY GET What You WANT - the PROBLEM With MANIFESTING! | Michael A Singer | Top 10 Rules - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"this whole thing about abundance and attracting to yourself what it is that you want and how to use mantras and spirituality to make sure you have what you want true spirituality is about not wanting is about being filled with joy from inside and then sharing that outside it's not about attracting to yourself what you want people ask me is there a law of attraction yes and you better be scared of it because if it's true that you attract what your mind is thinking you better take a look at what your mind is thinking what about your mind all day when it's complaining and it's yelling at people and it doesn't like stuff but if you're attracting that way so you eventually catch on that it is not about getting what you want it is about learning to find out that what you really want is to stay open and not have conditions on that openness and then it comes down to how do you do that are people capable of doing that or is that just reserved for you know some special beings Buddha and Christ that have walked the face of the Earth everybody is capable of that if I tell you to pick up five thousand pounds you may not be able to do that so I've told you to do something that you have never done and you're not doing it so you may not be able to do it but if you're actually already doing something and I tell you not to do it you're always capable of that because you're the one who's doing it need motivations watch a top ten with believe Nation hey it's Evan Carmichael and I make these videos my first business I struggled to believe in myself I quit on my business partner and the thing that saved me was watching the successful stories of entrepreneurs they gave me the inspiration to keep going as well as the strategies of what to do and quite honestly I still need their stories and motivation today as well so today let's learn from one of the best Michael Singer and my take on his top 10 rules of success enjoy inside you are the one who's closing your heart you close it you are the one who's closing your mind you do that they're your thoughts it's your feelings they're nobody else's so you are in there doing these things so if I tell you the way to stay open is to not close I don't teach how to stay open that's more like finding out how to get what you want I'm interested in you learning to not close but a difference if I say to you I want you to open your heart right now you wouldn't even know how to start but if I say to you somebody says and you don't like don't close you know where to start right because it's happening inside of you and you see the tendency to do it all I'm asking you to do is don't do that I'm telling you that will take you the whole way don't worry about opening worry about not closing there are going to be events that unfold in your life that naturally open you a beautiful sunset a bird singing sometimes you get what your mind wants all right you open great nothing wrong with that don't close how come it only last a minute I'm going to see a beautiful sunset you feel like oh my God I looked into the face of God then you go right back into your mind with all your problems why why don't you learn to not close why don't you get some openness start to work with yourself to not close and this is how to get what you really want the teeth the Deep spiritual teachings are really teaching you how to get what you want because what you want is to feel love and joy and happiness all the time and so if you can get that from within you then can share it rule number two is discover your real self the mind is very strong and one of the things the Mind does is develop methodologies or ways of thinking that let it interact with life and not get hurt and be more comfortable and it's the ego when we develop a self-concept and we change it through our lives but in general there's a self-concept sitting under there saying I was the one that did this and I was the one that went to the school and I'm the one that went there and the one that my father left or stayed or whatever the hell it is excuse me and basically uh all of this unfolds and you end up developing patterns of thinking based upon the experiences you've had all right and what I'm saying at least certainly in my experience is that's not what makes you wake up that's what keeps you from waking up all right the fact that you're identifying with these past experiences and saying that's who I am well it's not who you are you are watching your ego you see it get upset you see it fix things you see it have Concepts and Views and Etc et cetera and even you're obviously very intelligent you can use your intellect to support the ego to support that and and so on right and I'm sure yes you're a very special person very intelligent person and therefore that becomes part of your self-concept okay and then you say a religious person part of your self-concept all of these things are ways you think of yourself and there's nothing at all wrong with that it's wonderful you've been successful you're happy you're doing well all right I'm not happy I'm not doing well I just said that and also like weeping openly at this moment okay but listen to me right that identification with your personal self which is just your mind's thoughts are what keep you from waking up rule number three team is recognize your needs instead of asking why am I not okay why am I not okay you're asking what do I need to be okay that's the major difference of whether you're growing inwardly or you're attached to struggling externally is you think I can only be okay if I get the things that I got before or similar you extrapolate right things that made me had a relationship and eighth grade and it was so beautiful and she was redheaded okay my wife no that's not true all right he was redheaded and she left you know should her parents move right and it was never a bad experience in that relationship it was just the most perfect relationship you've ever had right you understand now if I'm grown up and I I go on a date and shoot a red hat she redheaded I have a pretense propensity toward being open you just asked a question why do we think we need these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man everyone would be proud of me and I feel like I'm helping the ecology and so all of a sudden I'm not okay I'm going to go to Tesla and if I get a Tesla oh my God for a while how am I doing wonderful so that's how you develop your preferences these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man and or perhaps a little time without the children and we make our list nobody's judging just be honest you put that down the purpose of this discussion is no matter what you put on that list unless you're very highly evolved my experience is it's not really what you want it's not that it's wrong it's just not really what you want and the way I prove that is as follows let's say you put down I want a relationship I want to meet somebody I want to have that special relationship and then I would ask you what if you would be the most amazing thing but it's Hollow for you you go there and you thought it would turn you on but it doesn't and you just Lowe's going to work and you're just not excited about it so therein lies the what do you really want because what you're going to find is if you were given the opportunity to have a relationship with that person I just described or have the job I just described but it didn't do SWOT for you and it left you hollow inside you would say I don't want it in fact if it's this video absolutely for free there's a link in the description below go click on it and start building the momentum in your life and your business I'll see you there rule number five is overcome anxiety what you want to do is say what's behind the anxiety so when when people talk I don't help people make decisions but we talk about decision making is the first thing that matters is what's your motive now what should you do if how can you figure out what to do if you don't even know your motive right and my you became 23 years old I realized that that voice was running my life and that's what you're saying if it wasn't comfortable I left if it you know whatever it was it was determining what I said it was determined how I acted it was determining everything about my life and yet I didn't know a thing about that voice why was it saying what it was saying why why is it like one person and not another because when you like somebody your voice says I like her so what that come from right and if all of a sudden it said no I don't think so I was in his glory because you know you pull yourself aside it's going to say a lot of stuff made me realize I don't listen to that thing that thing's crazy it just changed his mind all the time it says this it says that like the reason people drink and do drugs is because that thing's driving them crazy do you understand that are you trying to get away from that in inner mess that's going on inside so basically over the course of many years I started an experiment which was what would happen talking about the personal mind I like this I don't like that I believe in this I don't believe in that I want this to happen oh my God I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I'll die if it rains that kind of junk just the personal noise that instead of honoring and respecting life is judging it and trying to tell me how to make life be my way instead of my respecting that life took 13. notice amazing thing that energy that was all weird because you didn't touch it it changed it was able to come up all right or you start using affirmation right you sit there and say oh come on this is probably a an older person like my grandmother my grandmother I do yes yes that's right they get to drive and I should not be talking at them or bothering them or even sending them bad vibes maybe they should not be driving any faster well well and the point is it's a latter part of their life and at I trained Mickey this I trained Michael this way all right as I sit there and I look and I say how did it get hot be quiet how did it get hot what do you mean why is it hot well because there's a son out there you mean there's a star 93 billion miles away and you're it's hot it's so hot that you feel it's heat here I'm in Gainesville Florida Miami is about 300 miles away I asked them how big would a fire have to be in Miami for you to steal it in Gainesville if the whole town caught fire you would not even know being grateful and turned on by all of the amazing things that are happening in front of me and all the past experiences I got to have why don't I just enjoy all that and then come into life filled with love filled with joy and give the hold of my being to the moments that are unfolding in front of me that's that's what spirituality says so it's not about renunciation it's not about things are wrong and things are right it's about understanding that you did this you did this with your mind you set something reminds you of them when they were negative experience they tend to close you and that is where you get your list of what you want that's why all of our lists are different everyone's listening is totally different someone tells you this is the same as yours they're manipulating you because everyone has had different experiences and based upon those experiences it left these Impressions on your mind and you came up with this list of what I want so when you make the list of what you want make it through this and even if I don't whatever it is I will be a better person because of this if you're in into God running everything if that's your state God knows what he's doing there are so many different things that you can do with positive thinking to create a nicer environment inside in my opinion you have an obligation to do that both for yourself for the health of your body for people around you you just lift yourself up like he just says one should raise the selfless self not trample down the of course put aside some time in the morning and evening to remind yourself that this is what I'm doing annual number 10 the last one before some very special bonus Clips is work on yourself all you can be responsible for is yourself your starting position is right you have to evolve with the different situations that are presented to you and my experiences if you do that the rest will happen the people around you will be raised naturally understand that like if you bring anger into a situation imagine a household or always did you build this building I said yes he said would you build an addition on my house I swear to God that's exactly what happened all right and because I was surrendering to life nothing inside of me wanted to build clothes in the garage of this Sheriff all right I'm not even a builder I built a couple of buildings on my own land you know rough sawn Timber Etc and I said yes and that founded my first company built with love and I ended up building a custom houses and this and that and then I got into computers and the next pretty well because you made it this far in a video I want to celebrate you most people start and don't finish most people never actually follow through most people say they want something but they don't ever do the work to actually get it but you're different you are special believe Nation you made it here all the way to the end and I love you so as a special celebration if you put a hashtag believe down in the comments Below on this video I will showcase you and celebrate you s\"\nSummarize in bulletpoints", "length": 3273}

{"prompt": ":You have summarized this article\nThe complete guide to risk management in your mortgage.\n \n\nHer mortgage is a financial product in a changing market.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nHer residence is built of tracks. Each track is built from financial components such as interest, the consumer price index, bond derivatives, financial instruments such as a short-term lender and more.\n\nAll these elements are constantly changing as a result of macroeconomic changes, demands of the banks and expectations in the local and global capital market.\n\nWhen these things change, there is an impact on our mortgage and in this article I will guide you how to manage all the risks you have in your mortgage so that you never face challenges ranging from monthly financial pressure to forced eviction of your property.\n\n \n\nI'm writing you the guide because her mortgage, unlike the loans we take from credit companies or from our private bank account, involves hundreds of thousands of shekels for decades.\n\nWhen it comes to such sums for such periods, there are many risks and we will start detailing them one by one.\n\n \n\nFinancial risk of losing a large part of the equity-\n\nYou have decided to buy a house. Mazel Tov! The property you decided on costs a million NIS and you have 250,000 NIS equity. You did your tests, you signed the contract but your equity is sitting in the stock market and there is still a month until it needs to be transferred to the seller and you think: maybe we should leave it invested so that we don't miss gains in the stock market and lose money....\n\nRemember, as soon as you bought a property and signed a contract, you entered into a contractual obligation. At this moment, your equity is part of the deal and therefore, if your money is sitting in an investment account, just remember that the capital market can, sometimes, drop very sharply and it doesn't inform you beforehand and moreover, it usually takes a long time to rise back up.\n\nThis is of course not a recommendation of what to do or not to do, these are just a warning light for you of this risk that exists.\n\n \n\nRisk of additional costs around her mortgage -\n\nMany people do not understand that buying a property has many additional costs.\n\nCost of a broker, lawyer, mortgage consultant, purchase tax, moving expenses, etc.\n\nWhat happens is that people do not take this into account and then at the end of the process realize that they lack significant money.\n\nThey obtain the same money in an external loan for her mortgage where the monthly repayment is high.\n\nThis is exactly how people get into a financial spiral: beyond the commitment of the monthly repayment, they add a few hundred or thousands of shekels to the monthly commitment.\n\nYou have decided to purchase a property, stop and examine your budget in depth. Take into account all the additional costs that can reach hundreds of thousands of shekels and this is no joke.\n\n \n\nRisk of low ratings-\n\nBefore you receive money from the mortgage bank, the bank will ask you to bring an appraiser's opinion on the value of the property.\n\nSo where is the risk here? Let's see an example:\n\nYou buy a property for a million NIS and all you have in equity is 250,000 NIS in equity. Even if you transform yourselves and your families you will have no more money.\n\nThis is your first apartment, so the bank will be ready to give you 75% financing, which means that this NIS 250,000 is enough for you.\n\nWhat you must know is that the bank will give you 75% financing from the value of the contract or from the appraisals - whichever is lower.\n\nIn the same example, the appraiser comes and says that the property is worth 900,000 NIS and not a million.\n\nAt this stage, the bank will give you 75% of NIS 900,000 which is NIS 675,000 and you will be short of NIS 75,000 that you have nowhere to get them from.\n\nSo the risk here is for those who buy an apartment and their equity is limited and in that case, it is probably worth getting an appraisal in advance.\n\n \n\nRisk of not getting her mortgage as a result of incorrect submission -\n\nThe process to purchase a property with the help of a mortgage begins with approval in principle from the bank. That is, the bank gives you approval in principle based on what you fill out online or tell it on the phone. What this means is that, in principle, based on the data you provided, you receive approval.\n\nNow, before the bank transfers money to you, it will check as carefully as possible that it has all the details you provided. If you have not provided absolutely true data, the bank is entitled, even though you already have approval in principle and have signed a contract, not to approve the mortgage for you.\n\nIn the bottom line, you have to tell the bank the truth and at the same time tell it what it needs to know and nothing more.\n\n \n\nThe risk of losing tens and hundreds of thousands of shekels -\n\nThe banks that give us mortgages are business entities. They make money when they sell us money.\n\nThey buy the money cheaply (mainly from us - checking, deposits with zero yield) and sell this money to us at a high price in the form of loans and mortgages.\n\nThe bigger the loan, the more profit the bank can make and in the case of her mortgage it is clear what is happening.\n\nSo how do you not lose tens and hundreds of thousands of shekels on your mortgage -\n\nYou learn and understand everything you need to know in order to compare your knowledge with that of the banks.\n\nIt's either do it or take private mortgage advice. There is no other way to not lose money.\n\nUnderstand, the banks do the act of giving a mortgage every day and many times in the same day. They have systems that show them how much profitability there is on each track and they know how to build you the best mortgage... for the bank.\n\nYou must take responsibility here and know how to build a neighborhood that will be the best for you and only you.\n\nOnly in this way will you manage not to lose tens and hundreds of thousands of shekels.\n\n \n\nGet under financial pressure every month because the monthly repayment increases-\n\nThe monthly repayment of your mortgage can and will probably increase along the way.\n\nThe only option that it won't increase is if you take all of your mortgage on a fixed interest rate route and not linked to the index and you don't divide the mix into additional routes, which is probably not smart at all, but stable.\n\nLet's understand what can cause your monthly repayment to climb over the years-\n\nThe prime track - the prime track is built from the Bank of Israel interest rate and another one and a half percent. For the purpose of the example, the Bank of Israel interest rate is 0.5%, so the prime will be 2%.\n\nThe Bank of Israel interest rate can change as of today (2022) eight times a year. That is, the prime route has the potential to change 8 times a year.\n\nEvery time the banks of Israel raise the interest rate, your prime route will be automatically updated and your monthly repayment will increase.\n\nHow much will he grow? You should check this before you take the mortgage in the following way:\n\nOpen a mortgage calculator and enter in it the amount you take in the prime route, for how many years, at what interest rate and see how much you pay back per month.\n\nNow, go to the interest cell and increase it by a whole percentage. When you do this, the monthly repayment will go up.\n\nThe amount of the increase is what should interest you and the question you need to ask yourself is whether you will be able to meet the monthly repayment if the interest rate increases by 3%.\n\n \n\nAny route that is close to the consumer price index has a risk of increasing your monthly return and let's explain why-\n\nThe consumer price index is published every month and shows whether the prices of a basket of products have risen or fallen. The goal of the Bank of Israel is for the index to rise between one percent and three percent per year every year.\n\nLet's illustrate the issue with an example:\n\nTo take a million shekels from her mortgage at a fixed interest rate with the loan principal linked to the consumer price index for a period of twenty years. Your monthly repayment is about NIS 5,200.\n\n \n\nThe mechanism of linking to the index works as follows-\n\nEach month you take the index increase (or decrease) and multiply it by the mortgage amount you have left to pay. The result is increased (or reduced) from the loan fund.\n\nIn our example, if the index rose by one percent, then you take the million you took from the bank and multiply by the percentage and add the result to the million you took.\n\nYes, you took a million, you haven't done anything yet, only the index went up and you owe the bank one million and ten thousand NIS.\n\nBesides that it really sucks, the risk is a continuous increase in the monthly repayment because you will pay back the money you took in twenty years anyway. Now you have to repay more money at the same time and therefore the monthly repayment climbs.\n\n \n\nTracks change every two, five or any other frequency, contiguous or non-contiguous -\n\nWith her mortgage, you can take routes with a fixed or variable interest rate\n\nAccording to what we have learned so far, the safest and most stable but also the most expensive route is a route with a fixed and non-linked interest rate. After that, there is a route with a fixed interest rate and linked to the index, and you already understand this risk.\n\nOf course, there is the prime course which has the potential for a significant change and now we will talk about courses with variable interest rates, the most famous of which changes every five years.\n\nIn this route you can choose between a variable interest rate not linked to the index and a variable interest rate linked to the index.\n\nIn this route the interest is fixed for a period of 5 years and at the end of the five years it changes.\n\n \n\nAccording to what does it change?\n\nAccording to a fixed and clear mechanism that the bank has no control over. This mechanism is called the bond anchor. That is, when the bank quotes you the interest rate on the variable every five years, then it consists of an anchor and a margin. The anchor is external to the bank and is related to the yields of government bonds, while the margin is actually how much the bank wants to earn above the anchor.\n\nFor the purpose of the example: take a course that changes every five years linked to the consumer price index. The interest the bank gave you is 2.5%. The anchor today is 0% and for you the margin is 2.5%.\n\n5 years have passed and the change station has arrived.\n\nAll the bank does is go to the bond anchor and figure out how much it stands at now. If the anchor now stands at 2%, then the interest you will receive and will lock in for the next five years is 4.5%, which is made up of the margin you received and will always remain with you (2.5%) plus the current anchor.\n\nSo here there is a risk of an increase in the monthly repayment and if you take a variable interest rate every five years which is close to the dimension of the risk of a significantly higher repayment increase.\n\n \n\n \n\nNot meeting her mortgage repayments-\n\nWhen you take a mortgage, you have a big responsibility and it is to pay for it every month. It sounds obvious but life goes on and sometimes you don't pay attention and there is not enough money at the time of the charge and the mortgage comes back. This is an unnecessary risk that can harm your personal credit rating and your ability to improve your mortgage or refinance it to another bank.\n\nYou took out her mortgage, notice that there is money in the account for the monthly repayment.\n\nIn cases where there really is no money (and unfortunately there are such cases) then don't wait for her mortgage to be returned to you, rather be proactive and go to the bank to find one-off solutions such as freezing her mortgage until things work out. Don't give the bank a chance to get their hands on your house.\n\n \n\nEarly repayment fees-\n\nLook, when you take out a mortgage and you want to pay off parts of it, you are exposed to early repayment fees.\n\nThe high fees are mainly found in the fixed routes for long periods.\n\nDo you know that you are going to or need to pay off part of her mortgage in the coming years? Work smart! Build a mix that suits your needs and make sure you are not exposed to such fees more than you have to.\n\n \n\n \n\nHer mortgage insurance-\n\nHere, unfortunately, I have a very difficult experience and I am glad that I have the opportunity to tell you about it so that it will not happen to you.\n\nYou bought a house from a contractor/second hand! Mazel Tov. The critical time is between signing your contract and taking the mortgage.\n\nFor example: you purchased a property for two million shekels. You signed the contract and transferred half a million to the sellers. From that point you are in a situation of contractual obligation.\n\nIn the media and (tap tap tap tap) it calls a catastrophe between the signing and taking the mortgage will be a big problem.\n\nThe problem will start with the fact that it is not certain that they will let only one of the spouses take her mortgage alone, and if so then it will be very, very problematic.\n\nSo pay close attention to this issue please and don't play with it.\n\n \n\nDo not check cycle option-\n\nAnother very significant risk is to bury your head in the sand after receiving your mortgage.\n\nRemember, we started by saying that your mortgage is a financial product in a changing market. Sometimes the market changes in our favor and not taking advantage of these changes by partially or fully refinancing the mortgage is a risk no less small than any other risk.\n\nSo when should you check the feasibility of a cycle?\n\nThe answer is clear: every time your abilities, your needs and the market conditions have changed in your favor then it is worth checking.\n\n \n\nThat's it, that's all the many risks there are in her mortgage.\n\n \n\nI really hope that the guide will help you not to make mistakes and remember, Mishnetha?

{"prompt": "most concern single-plant herbal or phytomedicine (www.thecochranelibrary.com). In recent years, in the case of multicomponent herbal medicines, an increased number of RCTs on traditional herbal med- icine has been reported in the literature (World Health Organization 2004). For example, an Australian study on a Chinese herbal medicine prescription for the treatment of allergic rhinitis concluded that level II evidence is available that may substantiate the use of Chinese herbal medicine for both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (Xue et al. 2003). Unfortunately, the quality of the majority of the clini- cal studies of herbal medicines reported to date is of great concern due to a number of factors that have rendered the data of dubious value. In a review of 206 RCTs on herbal medicine, which was published in Medline from 1966 to 2003, important methodological components of RCTs, particularly alloca- tion concealment, generation of the allocation sequences, and intention-to-treat analyses, were incom- pletely reported. In these studies, only slightly over a quarter of the trials adequately reported blinding, and one-fifth reported generation of random allocation sequences (Gagnier et al. 2006). Furthermore, an earlier review of 2938 RCTs on TCM reported in 1980\u20131997 (Tang, Zhan, and Ernst 1999) con- cluded that the majority of these studies suffered from methodological defects. For example, only 15% of these studies used blinding, the sample size was mostly less than 300 patients, the controls were inadequate, few studies used quantitative outcome measures, and the studies were short term.\nThere have been many nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies on herbal medicines that have commonly supported the traditional therapeutic claims. However, systematic reviews of the study protocols or the data interpretation and validation are lacking. Further, the translation of an in vitro and/or in vivo biological/pharmacological effect of a herbal medicine to human therapeutic use may not be successful due to species differences or other mitigating circumstances, including the simple attribute of a biological or clinical outcome by the name of the mother herb, while neglecting the type of plant extract, methods of processing, and pharmaceutical formulation, which invariably contain varying content and proportions of active chemical components (Brinker 2009).\nIn addition to the preclinical biological or pharmacological issues, the quality of the herbal prod- ucts can affect the clinical outcomes and thus can impact their successful integration into EBM. Herbal medicine quality can be substantially different due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Species differences, organ specificity, and diurnal and seasonal variations are examples of intrinsic fac- tors that can affect the qualitative and quantitative accumulation of the biologically or pharmaco- logically active chemical constituents produced and/or accumulated in the herb. Extrinsic factors affecting the quality of the herbal medicine include environmental conditions, cultivation and field collection practices, postharvest handling, storage, manufacturing, inadvertent contamination, sub- stitution, and intentional adulteration (Awang 1997; Huang, Wen, and Hsiao 1997; Slifman et al. 1998; Mahady, Fong, and Farnsworth 2001; Cordell 2002; Fong 2002; Chadwick and Fong 2006).\n22.3 FACTORS RELEVANT TO/AFFECTING INTEGRATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE INTO MODERN MEDICAL PRACTICES\n\nA range of interrelated quality, safety and efficacy issues could contribute to the rational and successful integration of herbal medicine into modern medical practices.\n22.3.1 Herb QualIty Issues\n\nFundamental to assuring the efficacy and reproducibility of any medicinal agent, be it a single chemical or a complex herbal mixture, is the assured quality of the product. In the case of single chemical drugs, the quality and properties are well defined and documented in pharmacopoeias or on file with regulatory agencies or marketing authorities. On the other hand, herbal medicines, be they single herbs or polyherbal products, suffer from a lack of uniformity in their chemical and physical qualities due to various factors as mentioned above. All these factors have contributed to extensive lists of herbal medicines being reported in the scientific and lay media to be of inferior and questionable quality and authenticity.\n \n456 Herbal Medicine: Biomolecular and Clinical Aspects\n\nIn our early postmarket surveillance of selected commercial ginseng products prepared from Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer., P. quinquefolius L., and Eleutherococcus senticosus Max (eleuthero) marketed in North America in 1995\u20131998, we found that 26% of these products did not meet label claims with respect to the claimed ginsenoside content of the Panax ginseng and Panax quinquefo- lius products (Fitzloff, Yat, and Lu 1998). Studies on the quality of St. John\u2019s wort products showed the hypericin content ranging from 22% to 165% and silymarin content in milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.) products ranging from 58% to 116% of the labeled claims (Schulz, Hubner, and Ploch 1997). Gilroy et al. (2003) reported their investigation of herbal medicines sold as \u201cechi- nacea\u201d in the United States. A total of 59 products were studied (Gilroy et al. 2003) and of these, seven of nine so-called standardized products contained substantially less of the marker compounds echinacoside or cichoric acid than the stated content, with the other two being totally devoid of either compound.\nAnother major extrinsic quality problem concerns substitution and/or adulteration. Herbal medicines collected in the wild as well as some cultivated source materials, where more than a single species is grown in a given farm or site, can lead to nontargeted species being harvested by either accidental substitution or intentional adulteration. Substitution of Periploca sepium Bunge for Eleutherococcus senticosus (eleuthero) had been well documented (Awang 1997), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had traced the original adverse reactions attributed to plan- tain (Plantago ovata Forsk.) as having actually been caused by Digitalis lanata Ehr., a contaminant introduced during harvesting of plantains (Slifman et al. 1998).\nUnintentional in-process adulteration with heavy metals, microbial and chemical agents (pesti- cides, herbicides, and heavy metals), as well as with foreign matter such as insects, animals, animal parts, and animal excreta during any of the stages of source plant material production or procure- ment can result in unsafe source materials (Fong 2002). Besides unintentional in-process adultera- tion with heavy metals, it is well established that Ayurvedic medicine and TCM sometimes employ complex mixtures of plant, animal, and minerals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and gold in certain formulations (Ernst and Thompson Coon 2001).\nPerhaps the most egregious impediment to the integration of herbal medicine into conventional medicine is the intentional adulteration of herbal medicine products with synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Multicomponent Chinese or Ayurvedic herbal medicines have long been documented to be adulterated with synthetic anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone, indomethacin, and/or cor- ticoid steroids in arthritis remedies (Farnsworth 1993). A Taiwanese study on the chemical adulteration of TM found that about 24% of 2609 herbal remedy samples collected by eight major hospitals were found to contain one or more synthetic therapeutic agents (Huang, Wen, and Hsiao 1997). In more recent years, the most infamous among the documented cases was PC-SPES, a purported Chinese herbal mixture sold in the United States for the promotion of prostate health, and which was used by many prostate cancer patients for its remarkable efficacy. Unfortunately, reports proved the product to have been adulterated with estrogen, warfarin, and other pharmaceuticals (Blumenthal 2002; Cordell 2002). These cited examples are only a few of the quality control (QC) or lack of quality control issues associated with herbal medicines that greatly affect their successful integration into modern EBM.\n22.3.2 QualIty assurance/QualIty control In ProcessIng anD manufacturIng/ PreParatIon of Herbal meDIcInes (gooD manufacturIng PractIces Issues)\n\nThe most important extrinsic factor affecting the quality of herbal medicines is the lack of effec- tive policies on quality assurance (QA)/QC in the processing and manufacturing of herbal products under good manufacturing practices (GMP; World Health Organization 2007b). These can vary from country to country (World Health Organization 1998). In some countries, herbal medicines are regulated as medicine and subject to mandated standards, whereas in others very few botanical products are available as prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.\n \nIntegration of Herbal Medicine into Evidence-Based Clinical Practice 457\nThe majority of herbal medicines marketed in the United States are sold as dietary supple- ments under the provisions of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, and have only recently been mandated by law to be produced under cGMP (Food and Drug Administration 2007). Unfortunately, the QA/QC requirements are far short of those required in the production of prescription and OTC drugs. For dietary supplements, including herbal medi- cines, the requirements apply only to the manufacturers of the final product and not to the dietary ingredient suppliers, which have been the source of some of the most high-profile problems of adulterated, substituted, or contaminated ingredients associated with herbal dietary supplements. A study by (Liva 2009), which serves to illustrate this problem, described some cases of poor qual- ity controlled, unfinished herbal materials, including a hops (Humulus lupulus) extract, that did not meet the expected chemical profile but instead appeared to contain burned maltodextrin, Asian red ginseng (Panax ginseng), and wild yam (Dioscorea villosa) extracts containing quintozene, a fungi- cide that is illegal to use in herbal medicine, and in a solvent residue test, a purported ethanol\u2013water extract of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) was found to contain benzene, and a subsequent GC/ MS analysis showed 30 different acyclic and cyclic hydrocarbons, including benzene and toluene, which are known carcinogens. Until cGMP requirements are mandated and adhered to in the supply as well as in the manufacturing sides to ensure the availability of quality herbal products, herbal integration into modern medical practice will continue to pose problems.\nIn several countries, herbal medicines are totally unregulated. Consequently, product quality may differ from country to country, within the same country from product brand to product brand, and even from batch to batch within the same brand.\n22.3.3 Herbal mecHanIsms of actIon, bIoavaIlabIlIty, anD\nHerbs\u2019 cHemIcal constItuents\n\nThe underlying mechanisms of action of herbal medicine, whether single herbal or multiple herbal formulations, have generally not been elucidated due to the lack of knowledge of identifying their contained active and/or adjuvant phytochemical constituents. The same problem applies to the study of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. In the case of single-molecular pharmaceuticals, there is no uncertainty as to which chemical compound is to be used for pharmacokinetic and bioavail- ability studies. Herbal medicines are constrained by their unknown and/or unidentifiable active chemical constituents (Fong et al. 2006). Nevertheless, some investigators have attempted to con- duct such studies. For example, the mechanism of action of a Chinese herbal medicine formula (consisting of seven herbs formulated based on the results of a series of in vitro experiments and a comprehensive literature review) was postulated from a study of its in vitro effect on rat peritoneal mast cells and macrophage cells (Lenon et al. 2009). It was found that the formula significantly inhibited the release of several inflammatory mediators, including histamine and prostaglandins, which led the researchers to conclude that it has multiple mechanisms and that potential synergistic effects of the individual herbal constituents could all have contributed to the actions of the formula. Unfortunately, the potential clinical antiallergic effects of the formula are yet to be tested through adequately powered RCTs, which brings into question the validity of such postulations.\n22.3.4 Herb\u2013Drug InteractIons\n\nReports on herb\u2013drug interactions are mainly from case reports that were inadequately documented and/or on the basis of in vitro studies (Awang and Fugh-Berman 2002). A recent review based on extensive literature search suggested that, when herbs are often administered in combination with drugs, there were only limited clinical observations on the interactions among humans (Hu et al. 2005). Nevertheless, the potential of interactions of herbal medicine with prescribed drugs or OTC drugs has been a major safety concern for clinicians as such interactions are difficult to predict and the general lack of available information on the herbs\u2019 composition and pharmacological actions (Zhou et al. 2007).", "length": 3445}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n Special Conditions\n From Jeremy\nI find this material fascinating but you don\u2019t have to read it unless you have one of the headlined conditions. This is an effort to give some help to people with serious conditions who are likely to need medical help, or at least some level of medical supervision as well as \u201cbook help.\u201d \nThere are some more extreme or special conditions causing back pain for which you are going to want to receive individual guidance from a physician but for which you may also get substantial help from the book. Here and elsewhere, you may ask: If I have to go to a therapist for this anyway, why not leave it all to him or her? The answer is twofold. First, the concepts and exercises in the book will give you a great foundation on which to build the more specific treatments suggested by your caregiver. But, second, in my experience, too many therapists treating these conditions jump right into the specific exercises and stretches for these conditions without building an adequate foundation of spine health and strength. That\u2019s what this book does. \nSo . . . get started with this book and then seek out specific treatment. But be alert: Some of these exercises can exacerbate pain for some sufferers. If that happens to you, stop. Sorry that this is so complicated. You are almost always going to get substantial help from the general advice you have already read but\u2014for these special conditions\u2014you will also benefit from the specific advice in this chapter. See your doctor and strike your own balance between medical help and the advice we offer here. It is a two-sided approach and\u2014often with these special conditions\u2014both can help. Typically, the medical help alone\u2014great relief though it may be\u2014is not going to provide a complete, permanent solution. \nDisc Herniations\nThis means a burst disc and it is very serious business, as you already know. You should start by seeing a medical doctor. If a doctor has told you that you should try conservative (that is, nonintrusive) care for a herniated disc but you are in too much pain to start this book, you may benefit from a steroid injection to calm the pain down. I am slow to recommend that step, but this may be one of the situations where it makes sense. Sometimes an injection can bring the pain and inflammation down to a tolerable level so that rehab exercises can be undertaken. You should be warned that steroid injections can slow the healing process of a herniated disc. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of a steroid injection.\nIf you are having pain down your leg from a herniated disc, something called nerve flossing can sometimes help. It may sound like a joke, but it is not. Nerve flossing is a technique that attempts to traction or \u201cscrub\u201d the nerve roots as they exit the spinal cord near the herniated disc to remove material that sometimes builds up on them. If there is \u201cstuff\u201d stuck to the nerve roots or nerves (it is likely to be either pieces of disc material or scar tissue), that \u201cstuff\u201d can cause or exacerbate pain, and removing it can help a lot. Nerve flossing can sometimes do precisely that and provide significant relief. Caution: This technique can sometimes cause an increase in pain initially, before it reduces it. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. But it works enough to be worth the shot. There are countless YouTube videos out there on this subject. My favorite approach is Dr. Stuart McGill\u2019s. He has various videos and describes his approach in detail in his books. \nHypermobile Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Pain\nThis pain can be one of the most difficult and stubborn conditions to treat, in my experience. The sacroiliac, or \u201cSI,\u201d joint is the joint in your pelvis where the sides of your pelvis connect with your sacrum. \nThe SI joint is not supposed to move very much in a healthy individual. It is crossed by large ligaments and muscles that keep it taut. SI joints that move too much can cause recurring episodes of severe pain. This commonly starts with a sprain of these ligaments from a hard fall to the buttocks or from giving birth. Once the ligaments are deformed, the SI joint can become unstable. Learning to engage the core and gluteal muscles at the appropriate times can help people with chronic SI pain. \nA medical intervention is sometimes needed. One approach is prolotherapy, an injection therapy whose goal is to tighten up loose ligaments and stabilize joints. An irritant is injected around the SI joint to cause scarring and stiffening of the ligaments that cross the joint, resulting in a more stable joint. In my experience, this works slightly more than 50 percent of the time. Try this book first and see how much relief you get. You will likely get significant relief. If not, consult several prolotherapy practitioners before deciding to try it. \nBefore considering prolotherapy, try these exercises in addition to the ones you\u2019ve already learned.\nIsometric Adduction \nThe goal here is to strengthen the muscles on the insides of your legs without moving the unstable SI joint. You will need a medicine ball, thick pillow, or something similar for this exercise.\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back with your knees bent. Put the medicine ball between your knees. \nStep 2: Find your neutral spine and brace your core.\nStep 3: Squeeze the ball between the knees with 50 percent strength, being careful not to lose your core brace. Hold for ten seconds.\nStep 4: Repeat ten reps. Do two to three sets. \nIsometric Abduction\nAs with the previous exercise, the goal is to avoid moving the unstable SI joint. The difference here is that you are working on the muscles on the outside of your hips. You will need tubing or an elastic band for this exercise.\nStep 1: Lie on your back with your knees bent. \nStep 2: Find neutral spine and brace your core.\n\nStep 3: Wrap the band or tube around your thighs and below the knees.\n\nStep 4: Engage your glutes and move your knees outward about 45 degrees.\nStep 5: Hold ten seconds.\nStep 6: Do ten reps, two to three sets.\n\u201cBicycles\u201d on Your Side\nThis exercise is very challenging to do properly. One of the goals is to keep your leg in the same \u201chorizontal plane\u201d throughout. By this I mean not to let your leg wander up or down if you were viewing it from the side. Rather, keep it steady with the knee and foot in the same position relative to each other throughout the movement.\nStep 1: Lie on your side with your top arm on the floor in front of you for support.\nStep 2: Brace your core.\n\nStep 3: With the movement of bicycle pedaling in mind, raise your top knee up toward your torso and then push the foot out in front of you. Then bring it back behind you to make a big circle at the hip, as if you were pedaling a bicycle on your side. As you bring the leg behind you, focus on engaging the glutes and opening up the front of the hip.\n\nStep 4: Go only as far as you can without moving your back. \nStep 5: Do ten reps. \nStep 6: Then, go the opposite direction. \nStep 7: Push your heel back behind you, engaging the glutes and stretching out your hip flexors as your foot goes behind you. \nStep 8: While moving the leg, do not let it wander up or down. In other words, stay in the same horizontal plane the entire time. \nBulging Disc\nMost bulging discs will heal on their own if pressures are taken off and the bulging disc is given the chance to recover. The most important thing with a bulging disc is to stop irritating it. You will need to limit activities that put the most pressure on the disc. This means doing much less of any activity that involves a seated position (driving, flying, etc.) as well as picking things up with a rounded back and twisting with the low back (golf, tennis, etc.). There are ways to continue to play these sports without twisting or bending the low back. Remember the concept of creep when you are required to sit. Break it up into twenty- to thirty-minute increments if you are required to sit all day. Avoiding creep is even more urgent when you have a bulging disc.\nFor some people, \u201cpress-ups\u201d can help with bulging disc pain. These were initially recommended by Dr. Joseph McKenzie in his McKenzie protocol. His idea was that this exercise helps to shift the disc back into its natural position. \nPress-Ups\nI have seen some people, but certainly not all people, benefit from this. But it is worth a try.\nStep 1: Lie facedown on the floor with your elbows bent and your arms flat on the floor on either side of you, palms down.\nStep 2: Lightly brace your core. \n\nStep 3: Here\u2019s the hard part: You are going to attempt to press your upper body up off the floor without using the muscles in your low back. Your arms should be doing all of the work and your low back should be relaxed. If you have a bulging disc and you start to lift your torso up with your back muscles, there\u2019s a good chance they will go into spasm and make things quite a bit worse. \n\nStep 4: Very slowly and very carefully, start to push your upper body up off the floor. If your low back muscles kick in, stop and slowly \nlower yourself back to the floor to start again.\nStep 5: Continue up slowly. Go only as high as you can without your back muscles kicking in and without pain. Hold for ten seconds.\nStep 6: Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position using only your arms. Repeat five to ten reps. These can be done daily. \nStenosis\nSevere stenosis can be a serious problem and you may need medical help. But it is also true that often the things we have taught you so far will help quite a lot. Indeed, they may be an answer, so it is worth a try. We do not hold out the promise of an 80 percent success rate with severe stenosis, but the chances of success are substantial and well worth a try. Cases of mild to moderate stenosis typically respond very well to the approaches presented in this book.\nThe process will seem familiar now. Primarily, it is just a matter of finding (and maintaining) your neutral spine so that the irritation can die down. Once you feel comfortable with neutral spine, start to try walking again. For most people with stenosis, walking for moderate distances can be a problem. Make sure to keep your neutral spine and swing your arms from the shoulders as we talked about earlier. In addition, stop and take breaks and sit down before the pain starts. Eventually try to increase the distance you can go between sitting breaks. With increased fitness and endurance in the core muscles, these times between sitting will get longer and longer. Again, I caution that if you have very severe stenosis, you may be one of the relatively few who need surgery. This is especially true if you have leg symptoms and/or weakness. That said, I have seen countless patients whose MRIs showed moderate to severe stenosis (lateral or central) who were able to get back to a low level of pain and high level of function without surgery. So it is worth a shot. \nFor many with lateral or central stenosis, bicycling can be a great way to get exercise and relieve the back, because of the forward-bent posture when on a bike. Another solution is to do the following stretch to relieve the discomfort caused by stenosis. \nStenosis Relief Stretch\nThis stretch is the knee-to-chest stretch for relief from stenosis. It is pretty simple and often effective.\n\nStep 1: Lie on your back.\nStep 2: Lightly engage your core.\nStep 3: Slowly bring your knees up toward your chest and grab your knees with your hands, pulling your knees into the chest.\nStep 4: Hold and breathe for thirty seconds. \nStep 5: Repeat five to ten times. This can be done throughout the day.\nScoliosis\nIf you have scoliosis, it is important to see a good physical therapist to get exercises prescribed for your specific body. One size does not fit all on this one, so we cannot handle it definitively in this book. Your therapist should take into account the degree of curvature you have in your spine and the cause of your scoliosis and prescribe treatment accordingly. For instance, scoliosis caused by a leg length discrepancy will sometimes respond to orthotics. Severe scoliosis might require a brace. There are various exercises and stretches to apply depending on your body. I recommend getting personal help from a skilled therapist while also embarking on the protocol presented in this book. \nPregnancy \nBack pain during pregnancy is extremely common. This is because of a host of factors including weight gain, hormonal changes, stress, and lack of sleep. It is a great idea, if you can manage it, to practice all of the advice in this book before you get pregnant and during the early stages of pregnancy. I quite understand that you have a lot on your mind during this period (when I wrote this, Michelle and I were less than a month away from having our first child), but doing these exercises will be a substantial blessing during pregnancy and after. Add it to the list. \nHaving made that boast, I have to admit that you will likely struggle with back pain to some extent no matter what you do. But the back pain will be a lot less. One of the reasons you get back pain in pregnancy is wonderfully logical: It is the release of the hormone relaxin. It is released into your body to prepare for the birth by causing the ligaments in and around the pelvis to loosen, which is a great idea if you are about to deliver a baby, but it also leads to instability in the spine and pelvis, and causes pain. It\u2019s a trade-off: It makes the actual delivery easier, but it causes some pain. The more stable and strong you are going into pregnancy, the better your chances of avoiding back pain. But there is this overriding bit of good advice: Regular exercise throughout pregnancy, including many of the exercises in this book (with light weight) can be done safely and will help a lot with back pain. Talk to your doctor about which exercises are safe for you and how much weight you can safely lift in each stage of pregnancy. You might want to bring this book to your doctor\u2019s appointment for guidance on whether the basic exercises are safe for you. \nIs all this worth it, just for the relatively short term of a pregnancy? Yes. First, it is not a short term, not if you are in serious back pain. And pregnancy is tough enough without the added burden of back pain. So give the preceding advice some thought. At some point you may have flare-ups of back pain, no matter what you do. At that point, you may want to find a good chiropractor and/or acupuncturist to help you. But find a good one, one who has had lots of experience treating pregnant women. Follow my general advice about finding such professionals. Then ask specific questions about your particular needs and concerns of their office manager when looking to make an appointment. \nOkay, that\u2019s it for these most demanding \u201cspecial situations.\u201d But I have seen this advice do a lot of good for those in these situations and felt compelled to include it. Again, it is \u201cblended advice\u201d: Use the book and see a medical or other specialized healer. And it may not give total relief, but there is a good chance that it will help a lot. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.", "length": 3714}
{"prompt": "this is chapter 19 \" \nCHAPTER NINETEEN\n Congratulations! And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative \"", "length": 3263}

known as ali words i have a bachelor's degree in philosophy and i've worked with and written about prometheus rising over the past five years last week we read chapter six the time binding semantic circuit if you missed it look it up on our youtube channel this session will also be recorded and uploaded so the exercises last time did anyone have a chance to try any of that i tried one um incidentally someone left a uh i came across a dvd of a movie called gods not dead and it is a christian film about an atheist professor who does not act like any philosophy professor i ever had um who's like violently atheist and he forces all the students on the first day of class to write like god is dead and this one kid he refuses um because he's like a devout christian and then it's like i didn't get all the way through it because of just like i've been busy lately but he uh it's about his relationship with god and i think the atheist professor at the end probably converts to christianity because he realizes maybe he should soften up a little bit but um so i'm not an atheist myself but it is definitely not the world view that i'm from it's from people that are like violently anti-philosophy whoever wrote that film uh it was very ignorant of philosophy and philosophers and like their arguments for the existence or not arguing for the existence of god just like had no connection with the history of theology like they could have just dropped in kierkegaard and resolved the whole thing so yeah i'm rambling now that's interesting but uh yeah it's good to find like movies are really easy you can find movies that support ideologies that you don't agree with um a good thing to look at that is of historical value is there a lot of um early ussr um cinema that were like avant-garde like they invented the montage so like you learn about the history of film but you also see how they're using it to like glorify the working class um and you can see a very different kind of dialectic good stuff um i had a question you know when i was doing this exercise i did get a short chance for it i find it quite hard to really have something of a new insight i was wondering if you had any like aha moments about this experience that you thought are interesting to share um not with that movie uh so one of the philosophers related to negentropy and accelerationism there's a whole movement now called accelerationism is nick land who is himself or maybe was an occultist he did stuff where he created a decimal based kabbalah system like starting with zero through nine called the pneumogram and it was like also based on like cthulhu and lovecraftian stuff but uh he has moved to china and i'm not totally up to date on him but his works at the very least are used by a lot of accelerationist they call themselves the dark enlightenment philosophers a lot of them are very fascist and racist and there are like subreddits where you can read um where they like post oh is it like the daily mold bug or something i don't keep up with it but uh and they like find articles that support their racist ideas and then they comment about it and it's interesting to see these people i actually read the subreddit for like a month or two like not every day and there were times where i could really feel the emotion and the hurt that some of these people had how threatened they felt and a lot of it is about themselves uh feeling threatened and that's like threatening their second circuit and even their their first circuit especially with the uh rioting that has happened in america this year there there were some telegram groups that i was watching where uh i was looking at both black lives matter groups and also reactionary groups just to compare the intel they were sharing was interesting and yeah it can be an experience watching like the black lives matter riots as they were happening on telegram yeah yeah i did the two sometimes you really feel definitely the different echo chambers and they touch uh here and there sometimes you know like uh even you'll see instances where the same info bit again it gets explained differently in these different groups and exactly each will use it uh just the same way as the other group is to um well fuel the fire of their cause and so on yeah i guess i stumbled yeah exactly like accidentally into this group or a couple threads that had to do with this new meme format which is um again you know relating a lot of mysticism and and philosophy ancient history you know things that are very dear to me and inspire me to do great you know people are putting this together and and sewing it into some kind of a you know ethnic supreme narrative and that's you know it's kind of quite shocking for me to see so then i figured hey let's stick around for a little bit and take a look because well i was going to go try anyway for the exercise but then to see again you know what is inspiring me to open my heart and develop things like empathy and altruism for other people it's fuel on the fire of their um like ethno nationalism and those kind of things it's it's really crazy to think about that i guess that was my my primary insight from from the exercise yeah that's what it was for me really is just having empathy and especially in the more extreme groups that um that you either agree with or you don't um they're all people and a lot of them in the more extreme groups are really afraid is what i've seen in the looking at like the more racist type groups and um you know they they deserve empathy even like anyone everyone does and if you can actually feel their fear even if you come to the conclusion that's irrational i think that that is a valuable human experience the time binding dialectic acceleration and deceleration in the dialectic between nature and the socially constructed world the human organism is transformed in this dialectic man produces reality and thereby produces himself and that is by burger and luckman in the social construction of reality the first and second circuits are evolutionary stable strategies they've worked in more or less the same form not just for primates but for other animals and many other species over vast eons of time the third semantic circuit is an evolutionary unstable strategy it could very accurately be called revolutionary rather than evolutionary the first two circuits are based on negative feedback in the biological sense they maintain homeostasis that is they return over and over to the same ecological ethological balances they function on negative feedback sorry the function of negative feedback is to return to such a steady state the time-binding semantic circuit is not based on such steady-state positive feedback it is a mechanism of what cyberneticists and biologists called positive feedback it does not return to a steady state but constantly seeks a new equilibrium at a higher energy level negative feedback returns to a fixed point like a thermostat positive feedback seeks a moving goal like a guided missile the first two circuits maintain that which is more or less constant in human affairs they are totally cyclical and relate directly to the cycles found in history by vico hegel and similar philosophers assert the third circuit has always been hemmed in and heavily sanctioned with rules laws prohibitions taboos etc because it breaks up such cycles it leads if unleashed to an upward hurling spiral in societies where the third semantic circuit has been partially unleashed it has never been totally freed in any society the upward spiral immediately appears this used to be known as progress before that word became unfashionable the upward spiral whether we call it progress or not is characteristic of what karl popper calls open societies these are secular humanistic societies cultures relatively free of taboo and dogmatism such freedom up to and including the present is only relative because many taboos are unconscious and pass themselves off as common sense or common decency whoever challenges them is by definition a heretic by definition a traitor or by definition an irresponsible nut rationalists who dominate in relatively open societies also have their own taboos as we shall see it was historian henry adams who first conceived the idea that there might be a mathematical expression describing the rate of change of human societies under the influence of newton's physics adam suggested and he was very tentative about this a fact to be remembered by those who ridicule his naivete that the utilization of energy might move forward as the inverse square of time just as newton's gravity functions as the inverse square of distance accepting the anthropology of his day adams assumed that humanity in its present form was about 90 000 plus years old he then reckoned that it took most of that time to arrive at galileo the scientific method beginnings of the industrial revolution and the great pleat and the great leap forward in energy utilization characteristic of the modern age or the open society since 300 is the inverse square of 90 000 adams assumed that the next great leap was inhab was happening while he was writing around 1900 300 years after galileo looking about him he decided this next jump to a higher energy was occurring in the researches of the curies who had just discovered radioactivity as many commentators have noted it is impossible to read atoms on the subject without feeling that he is very accurately forecasting the atomic age adams went further with the exhilaration of a great idea since 17 plus is the inverse square of 300 he predicted that the next great evolutionary stage would begin in 1917 plus and since the inverse square of 17 is 4 plus he predicted that the next step in around 19 uh that the next step would be around 1922 by then he said we should have infinite energy at our disposal it didn't quite work out that way nevertheless henry adams was on the right track his math was just oversimplified also on the right track was henry's brother brooks who is also looking for laws in history brooks observed a pattern which may or may not be entirely true but is as approximately true as the similar generalizations of vico hegel marx and twinbe every civilization brooks adams proposed goes through four stages one the monopolization of knowledge by priests eg the egyptian priests kept written language a secret among themselves as did the mayan priests two the monopolization of military power by conquerors who made themselves states or governments e.g a friend a french bastard tom payne's description of william the conqueror lands on the store a french bastard lands on the shore of england with the superior technology warriors on horse versus native warriors on foot and he becomes king his relatives and sycophants become lords of the land three the monopolization of the land by those landlords the extraction of tributes rent from those who live on the land four the monopolization of the issue of currency by national banks the extraction of tribute interest for each piece of currency put into circulation most civilizations seem to have gone through at least three of these stages not always consecutively some have passed through all four brooks adams also noted that centralized capital the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few interrelated families seems to have been moving steadily west throughout recorded history the first major accumulations are to be found in sumer the center of money power then shifted to egypt to greece to the italian peninsula to various parts of germany and then to london at the time brooks was writing around 1900 he saw the balance teetering between london and new york and he predicted the decline of the english empire would shift the balance to new york within the first half of the 20th century he seems to have been right brooks adams had no theory as to why this westward movement of wealth had been going on for 6 000 years he merely observed the pattern the shift is still continuing in the opinion of many for instance carl oglesby in the cowboy vs yankee war sees american politics since 1950 dominated by a struggle between old yankee wealth the new york boston axis which replaced london after 1900 and new cowboy wealth texas california oil and aerospace billionaires as of 1997 it looks like the cowboys are winning which is what you would expect if there were a real law between behind adam's east-west migration of capital one night in 1919 counts alfred korzynski awoke from a vivid dream tears of joy streaming down his face with a vivid sense that the passing of signals from generation to generation the third circuit time-binding function was what distinguished us from the other primates korzynski originally suggested that the time binding could be defined mathematically he dropped this idea later his math was as inadequate as henry adams but it is worth looking at for a moment to retrace the steps by which the actual law of acceleration was discovered what korzynski assumed at first was that if all the inventions discoveries etc of some hypothetical first generation of humans could be represented by p and the rates by which the second generation could surpass this r and mathematically the sum of total inventions discoveries etc at the end of the second generation would be p r p times r quite true algebraically then after third generation the stockpile would be p times r times r and after four generations p r r r generalized this becomes p times r to the power of t where c is the number of generations from whatever generation you have picked as your baseline uh there's a little blank in the copy of the pdf i have but it says the curve of if you put it on graph paper ascends more rapidly with each generation korzynski was looking straight at what alvin toffler later called future shock and was trying to write a mathematical formula for it many variables in economic t\"", "length": 3141}

YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0\n![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0)\n## Transcript:\n- [00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=0s) what does your morning routine look like at the moment morning routine is wake up if i round about what time uh i'm waking up these days around 6 a.m 6 30 a.m i'm trying to go to sleep by about 10 30 p.m sometimes it's 11 sometimes it's 10. i wake up um and i have to be careful here because i whenever i've described my routine in a little bit of detail people always say i can't believe you don't go to the bathroom that's like well of course i so i so i want to be clear i i take care of\n- [00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=33s) my basic functions um but when i wake up i make a bee line for sunlight uh so i'm gonna get sunlight in my eyes for the you know i'll probably go into the grave saying this so forgive me if people have heard me say this before but the single best thing you can do for your sleep your energy your mood your wakefulness your metabolism is to get natural light in your eyes early in the day don't wear sunglasses to do it takes about 10 minutes or so um if you live in a cloudy area if you're in the uk in the winter yes or\n- [01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=63s) the summer or the summer maybe you resort to some artificial light as a replacement but as much as one can get bright natural and if not natural artificial light in your eyes early in the day without sunglasses contacts and eyeglasses are fine don't try and do it through a window or windshield it's going to take far too long this sets in motion a huge number of different neurobiological and and hormonal cascades that are good for you reduces stress late at night offsets cortisol a million different things really that are\n- [01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=93s) good for you so i get that and yes somebody does that walk do a little walk ideally that would be a walk but sometimes we'll just go into the yard and have some coffee and and you know soak into whatever sunlight through through the clouds if it's a cloudy overcast day it might be 20 30 minutes if it's a um it's a very bright day it might just be a few minutes but really the the quality studies on humans that have looked at this say try and get as much natural light as you can in the morning hours whenever it is that that is for\n- [02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=120s) you especially the first three hours after waking if you can work outside great if you can get in your window because as opposed to just in a dark conference room that's better but if you can get outside that would be fantastic so i i get sunlight i hydrate i drink water and then yerba mate is my favorite form of coffee excuse me caffeine are you waiting how long are you waiting for 90 to 120 minutes are you doing any salts during that time are you taking any electrolytes in i am a fan of water with element before i had element packets i\n- [02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=148s) would just take a little bit of sea salt or pink salt your favorite element flavor i like them all there's one i don't like i'm not a fan of the chocolate one but i like it yeah some people love it my podcast producer his wife loves that so i give it to her the chocolate mint one but um i like the raspberry the um the citrus one i love that stuff mango chili is if you open the mango chili and breathed in shortly afterwards it's like being pepper sprayed it's absolutely insane it's like it's like\n- [02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=175s) being blasted in the face but yeah i mean that's that's just the best way that cold glass of water and that first thing in the morning and i mean it was you who uh reassured me of the what i thought was bro science about your adenosine system not being active for the first 90 minutes and if you're going to pump caffeine onto that you're not really actually acting on that your adrenal system is the one that you need to be looking at optimal you hydration all that sort of stuff it's just such a good\n- [03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=198s) way to start the day so okay we've got um 90 minutes deep what have you been doing in that you've had your light in the eyes what have you been doing between that and the yerba mata in 90 minutes i do everything i can to not do email not do social media and to take care of a few critical tasks these days i'm i have this obsession with trying to do one cognitively hard thing a day one and one physically hard thing a day now does it not extreme physical not david goggins level workouts or anything but\n- [03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=230s) um in that 90 minutes i'll typically try and read a research article start to finish or i'll work on a document that i might be doing a grant or research paper or planning a podcast or researching a podcast i try and get my brain into kind of a linear mode i try and narrow that aperture so i don't the distraction that's created by social media and interactions with others can kind of wick out into the rest of the day so i'm not necessarily trying to finish something in that time but i try and do something\n- [04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=258s) challenging i experience great pleasure from battling through something mentally challenging but that's something that i built up since my university years when i was about you know 19 or so got serious about school and really started to experience the the deep pleasure of like i figured that out or like that was really tough i don't always succeed but that's what i'm doing in that hour to 90 minutes but i confess sometimes we'll take a walk during that time and maybe talk through some things that are\n- [04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=287s) that are challenging you know or sometimes i get lazy and and i'll miss a day of that cognitive challenge then i do caffeine about 90 to 120 minutes after waking and even though i prefer to work out earlier i generally will then do some sort of physical workout i have a very consistent routine i've done over 30 years where i weight train for 45 or minutes to an hour every other day and occasionally i take an extra day off and occasionally due to travel or other commitments i'll occasionally double up\n- [05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=319s) two days and then take two days off yep so it's really boring you know talk about workout schedules but it's really simple it's like you know i'll do a uh kind of pushing day rest pulling day upper body push up rest upper body pull rest and then legs take two days off something like that are you doing on the off days are you doing some sort of zone three always jogging or skipping rope those are my favorite forms of cardio sometimes swimming but typically i'll go running for 30 to 45 minutes or if i'm\n- [05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=352s) feeling a little bit lazier because i always find the high intensity stuff to be easier than the long drawn out stuff i'll sometimes throw on a weight vest a 30 or 50 pound weight vest and i'll go out for a shorter run or i'll i'm a big fan of knees over toes ben patrick i know you had him oh yeah great we were down in costa rica with him and his wife who had the best time and learned so much um i'll occasionally um do a backwards you know he'll walk um or throw on the weight vest for that um\n- [06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=378s) we sometimes will get bands and we'll so there's a great way to combine this we will sometimes get two people in one of these thick bands do hill walks in the morning while getting our sunlight yeah but that i don't really consider a workout i consider that just kind of rehabilitate as a movement so on the off days i'm doing cardio and sometimes that's the morning sometimes that's in the evening i do not like to wait training on the second half of the day because i like to be really caffeinated\n- [06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=400s) when i train i like to listen to loud fast music most of the time not always i keep my phone out or off of for most workouts podcasts maybe if i'm running but i really try hard when i'm working out to just focus on the workout and those workouts the weight training workouts are always 10 minutes or so of warm up and then no more than 40 to 50 minutes of really hard work if i do train hard any longer i don't recover enough to be able to come in a few days later and when i train that way i generally make\n- [07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=431s) pretty consistent progress and you're taking yourself up until what's up probably maybe 10 30 11 a.m something like that yeah and then i'll eat my first real meal now occasionally i'll wake up really hungry if i didn't eat that well the night before but typically the after i train i yeah i'll eat i like oatmeal after i train oatmeal fruit some fish oil protein drink and then maybe 90 to 120 minutes after that i'll have a real lunch my lunch is pretty much the biggest meal of the day if i have my way\n- [07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=458s) it'll be a steak a salad maybe a little more starch although i sort of got it earlier um brazil nuts and that meal sometimes can extend longer than life i love being a feeding tube i love to eat yeah so i'll eat and then i confess i usually will work a little bit more for about 30 minutes or an hour typically email and then i'll take a um 10 to 30 minute yoga nidra nap or a nap and then come back refreshed um i really struggle with the naps when i come back after that and my emotions are all over the place i'm disoriented\n- [08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=490s) maybe it's because i struggle to fall asleep super quickly and therefore i'm extending that period out for a little bit longer than i need i probably need to try the yoga nidra thing but for me it's i'm absolutely all over if i do that i wake up and i don't know what day it is and my emotions always feel a little bit out of whack as well i wake up grumpy from naps sometimes i'm told okay there are a few times when i've woken up just really angry i have no idea what that's about i don't know any of the\n- [08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=514s) neurochemistry associated with that sometimes i wake up from naps it's really pleasant i'll occasionally do if the nap is early enough in the day afterwards i'll have a you know a nice double espresso and get back into work that's the hardest part of the day actually if i was well structured in the early part of the day it's that 2 or 3 p.\n- [08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=532s) m the key is then to try and get something really useful done cognitively again so some people might look at this and say wait you're working for an hour in the morning and 30 minutes here and an hour in the afternoon when are you actually working but it's really about the depth of the trench when you're working and so if i'm gonna drop into something again for a few hours in the afternoon i'm really going to drop into it and that's typically phone off and out of the room and my goal is to get to the evening time so that i can do the things\n- [09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-ezOLT2Kv0&t=556s) that i want what's happening people if you enjoyed that then press here for the full unedited episode and don't forget to

The virtual surgery solution had to provide secure access from practitioners\u2019 homes on their personal devices. This would allow them to continue to support their patients while self-isolating.\n\nSolution:\nTo this end, the NHS approached Login Consultants, an Orange Business Services company, and its partner VMware to design a \u201cvirtual surgery\u201d solution that could be rapidly deployed to general practitioners (GPs) and primary care workers.\nTo meet these needs, Orange came up with a solution based on a VMware virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). \n\nBenefits:\nThis approach both satisfies the NHS\u2019s stringent security requirements and allows medical practitioners to work from home. In a VDI environment, data remains on the server rather than on the end-client device. It protects data if an endpoint device is ever stolen or compromised and enables the secure use of personal devices.\n\n[Source: https://www.orange-business.com/en/case-study/virtual-desktops-ensure-doctors-can-keep-working-crisis]\nOur core capabilities include:\n\nConsulting:\nTechnical, quality and security audits\u200b.\nDeveloping relevant employee personas (and relevant workplace solutions), definition of KPIs, such as productivity, inclusion, and satisfaction.\nRoadmap, change management plan, and ROI analysis.\n\nEmployee equipment:\nDesign and enable the device\u00a0policy\u00a0(incl. nomad and hybrid\u00a0working); enroll, connect, secure,\u00a0manage the devices; manage\u00a0business application delivery and\u00a0patching.\n\nDigital applications and processes:\nBusiness application\u00a0development\u200b;\nAutomation\u200b;\nProcess\u00a0digitalization\u200b;\nLow/no code.\n\nCollaborative environment:\nIntegrated collaboration tools\u00a0(meetings, communications,\u00a0creativity, documents, etc.);\nSmart\u00a0office (employee on-site journeys,\u00a0video rooms, etc.).\n\nIntegration:\nCross-functional agile\u00a0teams (business consulting, data, and IT (cloud, connectivity, and\u00a0cyberdefense). \nLegacy application/process compatibility\u200b;\nWalk-in,\u00a0take-over, Multi Service Integration (MSI);\nCenters of Excellence (low code, Service Now).\n\nService management:\nBusiness outcomes delivery with end-to-end Quality of Service\u200b;\nProactive monitoring (AI-based) and cybersecurity to optimize application\u00a0speed and\u00a0data protection\u200b;\nCustomer success management (user support, troubleshooting, service\u00a0adoption).", "length": 3168}

When a student is not looking for a permanent stay or a year-plus lease & usually, they are moving to a new city where they do not know much about the zone.\nSolution Summary\nNEST provides a service to both, local landlords situated near the universities to prospect short- term rentals for their properties which aren \u0301t providing them any income and usually end up costing them. Students from all over the world are looking for an adequate place to live during their education with the right roommates for an appropriate rate. Through a compatibility test that will run a thorough matching from a sum of profile points, covering everything, from their budget and location to a match percentage for both landlords and current roommates of the property.\nMarket\nOur market consists mainly of young men & women which are mostly foreigner students looking for a room to rent, for a 3\u20136-month period, close to their college, we are talking about male and female only or co-ed apartments and houses occupied by students from 17 to 27 years old. Currently in Mexico City, one out of nine students are foreigners, looking for a place to rent, and the only one`s renting the rooms are independent landlords or mayor student residentials. That is why we attack two markets: the students which are at a high demand and landlords that have their properties on the leasing market, stocked and costing them negative cash flow on their maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses that come with owning real estate.\nUniversities in the city have housing programs where they need to locate their foreign students and also rent full houses at a high market value and accommodate their students.\n4\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

Our biggest competitor on the market now is roomiesmexico.com, which we \u0301ll use as a marketplace as well, just like all our competitors to begin our traction and generating massive leads.\nMarket Competitors:\n- https://roomiemexico.com/\n- https://en-mx.roomlala.com/\n- https://www.iroommates.com/\n- https://roomiapp.com/\n- https://www.roomgo.com.mx/ -\nWhy Us?\nNest provides more than just a space to live or a marketplace for roommates and students to find each other for a temporary home, it provides proven compatibility match between: Landlords, Students & Roommates.\nWe \u0301ll revolutionize the industry by making the whole experience more personal between the roommates that will end up living together. With a quick 3-minute test they will get a customized service that will help them accommodate better in their new home. As for the landlords, our software shall provide a friendly user experience for our management service and transaction management.\nExpectations Forecast Mexico City\nOur \u201cgoing to market\u201d strategy consists of a pre-campaign starting in December 5th for early showings to measure the demand and prepare for the high demand season in January. We \u0301ll attack the market by advertising our rooms on all the marketplaces, from Google \u0301s SEO to Facebook \u0301s Marketplaces, plus all the property searchers or IDX \u0301s, like our competitor \u0301s, while simultaneously bringing all leads to our platform to perform our compatibility test.\n5\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE. This business plan contains confidential, trade-secret information and is shared only with the understanding that you will not share its contents or ideas with third parties without the express written consent of the plan author.\n \nNEST STUDENT CO-LIVING\n The three main sources of income at the beginning are clear, the first and most important: Our service deserves a fee, when addressing any service on the market, the price of $500 MXN is reasonable and any student will gladly pay, even without warrantying their stay at that first room, but to have access to the community and our match platform with property search & matching algorithm. The investigations or \u201ccompatibility test\u201d, per room-rate shall not surpass the 6 to 1 ratio.\nThe second source of income is the lease or listing commission fee to the landlords that we \u0301ll assist occupy their vacant property and rent it for a higher rate than the one they would \u0301ve gotten at the regular lease market. On the first phase of the project, we \u0301ll charge 50% of a month \u0301s rent per room, naturally to the landlord.\nThe third source of income is the management fee, a 15% management fee from each month \u0301s rent per room to the landlord that acquire this optional but preferred service to help control the variables of the tenants/students.\nFinancial Highlights by Month Mexico City\n9 Room Projection:\n Room #\nRent/Month Rent Fee (50%) Admin Fee Test Fee/Room (15%)\n Gross income/Room\nRoom 1\n$ 5,000.00\n$ 2,500.00\n$ 750.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 2,500.00\nRoom 2\n$ 5,500.00\n$ 2,750.00\n$ 825.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 2,750.00\nRoom 3\n$ 6,000.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 900.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,000.00\nRoom 4\n$ 6,500.00\n$ 3,250.00\n$ 975.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,250.00\nRoom 5\n$ 7,000.00\n$ 3,500.00\n$1,050.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,500.00\n Room 6\n$ 5,500.00\n$ 2,750.00\n$ 825.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 2,750.00\nRoom 7\n$ 6,000.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 900.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,000.00\n Room 8\n$ 6,500.00\n$ 3,250.00\n$ 975.00\n$ 3,000.00\n$ 3,250.00\nRoom 9\n$ 7,000.00\n$ 3,500.00\n$1,050.00\n$ 3,000.00\n $ 3,500.00\n TOTAL\n$ 55,000.00\n$ 27,500.00\n$ 8,250.00\n$ 27,000.00\n $ 27,500.00\n 6\n CONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

Even after you find a suitable place to live, close to your school and public transportation, perfect location, you must deal with your roommates. It is not easy to live with someone that you know, now imagine someone you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a big factor for anyone looking for a minimum 3 month stay.\nThe growth of the student market has created a very high demand of short-term rentals, there a various modalities: Family rents a room to a student, student housing, student co-living buildings, roomies rent out rooms and subletting. The problem is they are all spread through different markets, that is how we solve the problem for the landlords.\n7\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.

Compatibility on: Location, measuring distance from their school, public transportation (if needed), hospitals, shopping centres, gyms, restaurants & bars. Age, careers, hobbies, routines, likes and dislikes, pets, and much more are included on our test created by a psychologist to match different profiles and help the student create a sense of trust when renting a room.\nWe have easily identified the area for opportunity within the market, when we talk about student housing, not all universities share that luxury, which gives light to millions of young first timers looking to rent a room, and the vast majority has no experience whatsoever, thus our opportunity. The student market, for years to come shall be integrated purely by millennials, the most \u201cTech- Practical\u201d or \u201cTech-Dependant\u201d generation of all time. By creating an easy user experience throughout the: SEARCH, PAPERWORK and PAYMENT linked to renting a room in any mayor city, we can attract all of them.

Co-living was inspired to create a unique and high-quality student living concept in India by a combined experience in the student housing market in India and overseas. The potential lines in the gap in India\u2019s student housing industry in terms of quality infrastructure and personalized services. In India, the student housing business generates more than $15 billion in revenue yearly and is predicted to rise by multiples. The segment receives a demand from approximately 11 million migrant students on average. Hence, there is a strong need for a professionally managed, tech-enabled student living experience, and that consumers are eager to try out a new value proposition.\nColiving is a new type of housing in which inhabitants share a living space and a common set of interests, values, and goals. It\u2019s a fresh perspective for the millennial age, emphasising openness, collaboration, social networking, and the sharing economy. Nowadays, students prefer co-living accommodations since it provides them with a greater sense of independence. Being away from parents, moving to a new city, and adjusting to life away from home are hard tasks. Students must have the confidence to make their judgments when moving away from home and settling in a new location. Fully furnished rooms, cleaning and maintenance services, utilities, furniture, and other amenities are all included in co-living accommodations. Currently, the real estate business is concentrating its efforts on Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Jaipur, and other educational hotspots.\nCo-living, which is sometimes referred to as \u201can extension of dorm life,\u201d allows renters to rent a private bedroom within a bigger apartment. All co-residents share living rooms, kitchens, and other common areas. Cleaning services, pet care, and cooking tips are frequently included in the package. Co-living differs from room sharing in that a tenant has an individual lease rather than a shared lease and is thus only responsible for their bedroom and bathroom. Co-living is an excellent alternative to an oversupplied luxury multi-family market from the standpoint of landlords and developers. Young renters with disposable income can benefit from co-living situations.\nSWOTS\n9\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE. This business plan contains confidential, trade-secret information and is shared only with the understanding that you will not share its contents or ideas with third parties without the express written consent of the plan author.\n \nNEST STUDENT CO-LIVING\nMillennials and other renters are looking for new technologies as they hunt for new ways to rent. Co-living is a fantastic illustration of this because it is a technology-driven service that gives tenants and landlords more options.\nSimilarly, solutions such as lease guarantee or security deposit replacement are allowing millennials to move when and how they choose. Anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of business and economics understands that the sharing economy is the way of the future. The sharing economy is where supply meets demand. It all started when the internet changed the way people communicated. The Internet leveled the playing field and encouraged businesses to digitize their data. The way we gain information and communicate has altered because of search engines and social media.", "length": 3624}

{"prompt": "Read the following paper and give me tips to improve:\nAs a school leader with a math curriculum focus, I would like to propose a curriculum initiative that focuses on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics. This initiative aligns with the district's vision of getting students enrolled, enlisted, or employed after high school by showing them how they can use mathematics in their post-high school careers. The initiative will address the needs of diverse learners, including the Black, Latino, and Indian populations, and initial implementation will be inclusive of the 9th-grade Mathematics 1 course. \nTo determine the greatest areas of need and to choose a curricular initiative that would address the need, I will collaborate with building and district leaders and stakeholders. We will use data from the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 9th-grade students to show the benefits of the new curriculum model. We will use PSAT data from fall to spring and NWEA data to compare student performance. This initiative addresses the school-wide need of improving student achievement in math.\nWe will implement this program using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute. The team will consist of 16 9th-grade math teacher volunteers from the schools in the district. The cost will be approximately $7,680, which includes $40 per hour for teacher workshop rate, 2 hours of work time per week for 6 weeks, and the cost associated with purchasing the program materials. Professional development will be necessary to ensure that all instructional staff implements the initiative with fidelity.\nAs a school leader with a math curriculum focus, I will collaborate with the director of curriculum and instruction in determining curricular programming needs for the school. I will advocate for the needs of my school and request individualization or customization regarding the curricular program chosen by my group to meet the unique needs of my building. I will also ensure that standards-based assessment systems are used to determine the effectiveness of the curricular initiative, and the data gathered from the assessments will be used to inform internal and external audiences about the effectiveness of the curricular initiative.\nThis curriculum initiative focusing on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics will be beneficial for improving student achievement in math and will align with the district's vision of getting students enrolled, enlisted, or employed after high school. The initiative will address the needs of diverse learners, and by using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute, we can ensure that all instructional staff implements the initiative with fidelity.\nIntroduction\n\n High School Mathematics in many traditional classrooms with lectures, worksheets, quizzes, worksheets, tests, and more worksheets is rather dull. Students who are taught math in this manner tend to miss the mathematical connections to their out-of-school lives, and success in math is only valued for the sake of being able to do well in other math classes. When students do not see value in mathematics, they will not use it to analyze the sociopolitical sphere of their lives. Thus they will not be able to participate in our democracy fully. This trend of math illiteracy is extremely prevalent in the African-American community. For us to have citizens that are able to question and critique the world around them, we need to change how mathematics is taught. The purpose of math education in the words of Ernesto Gutstein \"students need to be prepared through their mathematics education to investigate and critique injustices, and to challenge,in words and actions, oppressive structures and acts - that is, to 'read and write the world' with mathematics.\" (Gutstein, 2006, p.4) To reach the goal of mathematics education as described by Gutstein, I propose a high school mathematics curriculum infused with the ideas of social justice. This curriculum will make students mathematically literate and show them how to use it in math class and read and write the world around them. \nLiterature Review\n This trend of mathematical illiteracy can be attributed to \"number numbness.\" Number numbness is described by Bob Peterson in his article \"Teaching Math Across the Curriculum.\" Number numbness is the view that mathematics is only good in math classes and it is not important to your life outside of a math classroom. Peterson attributes this to how math has been taught through the years \"historic problems with math instruction itself: rote calculations , drill and practice ad nauseum, endless reams of worksheets, and a fetish for 'the right answer'.\" (Peterson, 2006, p. 10) Number numbness also comes from the fact that math is traditionally separated from all other subjects and from issues that confront students in their daily lives. There are consequences of math being isolated according to Peterson: first, math is seen as relevant only for the sake of future math classes. Second, students view math as disconnected from their social reality. Third, if students are not taught ways to apply math they will not be able to fully participate in society. Math is like a language: it is a discipline unto itself and \"a tool to understand and interact with the world and other academic disciplines.\" (Peterson, 2006, p. 10) When math is seen as a crucial aspect of students' social lives, then transfer of mathematical skills to other disciplines will occur. \n The key when choosing social justice issues to address is to be culturally relevant. When students have a connection to what is being taught, they are more likely to want to learn. There is a lack of culturally relevant teaching towards African-American students. (Ukpokodu, 2011) (Moses, 2002) \"The teaching of mathematics needs to be connected to the lives of African-American students to enable them to fully take part in our democracy. Traditionally schools have not provided African-American students opportunities to do so.\" (Tate, 2006, p.31) Carter G. Woodson described how teaching African-American and White students the same mathematics was detrimental to African-Americans. More than 60 years ago Carter G. Woodson described this dilemma in his book \"The Mis-Education of the Negro\":\n \"And even in the certitude of science or mathematics, it has been unfortunate that the approach to the Negro has been borrowed from a \"foreign\" method. For example, the teaching of arithmetic in the fifth grade in a backward county in Mississippi should mean one thing in the Negro school and a decidedly different thing in the white school. The Negro children, as a rule, come from the homes of tenants and peons who have to migrate annually from plantation to plantation, looking for light which they have never seen. The children from the homes of white planters and merchants live permanently in the midst of calculations, family budgets, and the like, which enable them sometimes to learn more by contact than the Negro can acquire in school. Instead of teaching such Negro children less arithmetic, they should be taught much more of it than the white children, for the latter attend a graded school consolidated by free transportation when the Negroes go to one- room rented hovels to be taught without equipment and by incompetent teachers educated scarcely beyond the eighth grade.\"(Tate, 2006, p.31)\nMost of this still holds true even today. From Woodson's argument, we see that students have two facets of learning, inside of school and outside of school. (Tate, 2006) With these two facets in mind we need to develop a math curriculum that touches both. Another thing Woodson highlights is that mathematics curriculum is not neutral in nature, different students need to be taught differently. \n\nCurriculum Proposal\n Social justice ,as I will use it here, is the distribution of advantages and disadvantages within a society. Mathematics is the language used to describe the relationship between figures and quantities. My proposed curriculum is a project based addition to a curriculum that is already present and will vary from classroom to classroom with only the central tenets remaining the same. The curriculum will be project based because that is the best way in my opinion for a social justice & multicultural approach can be reconciled with the standard based classroom. Sleeter states \"high standards and standardization are not the same, yet they have been treated as if they are.\" (Sleeter, 2005, p.3) While these words ring true, the standardized tests, worksheets, and classic math tests cannot be abandoned, however we can add to them. \nThe main goal of my curriculum is to create a math course where mathematics is learned and then applied to look at social issues. The central tenets of this curriculum will be based on the ideas of Criticalmathematical literacy. (Frankenstein, 2006) The tenets are: 1) Understand the mathematics. 2) Understand the politics of political knowledge. 3) Understand the politics of mathematical knowledge. 4) Understand the politics of knowledge. These tenets should lead the teacher when unit planning, the mathematics being taught and the social issue being addressed must be thought out thoroughly with each tenet. \nWhen planning teachers must start from the mathematical standards, these will come from a national, state or local organization, this is important to make sure that is meant to be covered is met. From here we can see how the math that is supposed to be taught can address a social justice issue, fitting the issues to the math, not fitting the math to the issues. When unit planning essential questions based on the mathematics knowledge and the social issue should be taken into account. In the classroom units should begin with an overview/ introduction to a social justice issue, then the mathematics concepts of the unit should be taught ( the issue introduced in the beginning can be weaved through the class periods but it does not need to be in every lesson). The unit should end with a standard mathematics test with short answer and multiple choice questions. in addition to the unit test a project based performance assessment should be issued where students provide a solution to a social justice issue utilizing the mathematics that they have learned. \nAssessment/ Project Ideas\nDue to the nature of this social justice infused curriculum, assessments and projects implemented will vary based on the mandated curriculum. The following are examples of possible assessments/ projects.\n\n\"Averages\" (Osler, 2007) \nUnion Salaries\nCalculating the \"average salary\" of a worker from a set of employee salaries to see how mean/median/mode could result in different averages\nUS Casualties in Iraq\n Take casualty data for the past 12 months and calculate a monthly average from the perspective a military recruiter and from an anti-war activist \n\nFractions/ Proportions/ Ratios (Osler, 2007) (Peterson, 2006) ( Frankenstein, 2006) \nWar Budgets\ncomparing military budget to other services in the U.S. budget\nActivity cartoon analysis\nProbability (Peterson, 2006)\nRacial Profiling ( Driving while Brown/Black)\nExplore what the probability that a traffic stop should be of a person of color. Compare this to what the percentages of actual stops for people of color. \nGeometry (Osler, 2007)\nLiquor Stores/Fast Food Density \n Look at how many liquor stores/fast food chains are within a 1-mile radius or within 5 blocks of your school. This can be compared with schools in other neighborhoods\n Environmental Racism \n Determine the density of toxic waste facilities, factories, dumps, etc, in the neighborhood\nGentrification\n Change in the density of people in a neighborhood (by race/income)\nAs we can see there are many possibilities for adding issues of social justice into a mathematics classroom. Activities such as these show students the link between mathematics and the sociopolitical world along with drawing their attention to injustices around them. \nReferences\nFrankenstein, M. (2006).

{"prompt": "this is an audio transcript of a video, it includes timestamps in the format of [0:00], please rewrite the text removing the timestamps and correcting any transcription errors, ensure that you rewrite the entire transcript:\n\n[0:00] we talk a lot about semantic HTML but[0:03] what about semantic CSS they're coming[0:05] up with good class names in CSS is[0:07] always a bit of a struggle it's maybe[0:09] one of the more infuriating things which[0:11] is why we have so many different naming[0:12] conventions and different approaches to[0:14] authoring CSS especially when it comes[0:16] to organization and dealing with[0:18] selectors so we can attempt to give[0:20] things meaning with names but of course[0:22] the class name doesn't have any real[0:24] meaning it's easy to get them wrong and[0:26] well of course things like this would[0:28] work just as well if you were to take[0:29] inspiration from my son and use a class[0:31] like big butt[0:37] wait no no[0:49] that's probably not the best idea in the[0:51] world and people might be a little bit[0:53] confused if they're working on that code[0:54] base and come along the your big butt[0:56] class there but of course if that class[0:58] was in your HTML that selector would[1:00] work perfectly fine but if somebody were[1:02] to randomly come across it they'd really[1:04] have no idea what you were actually[1:05] wanting to do with it and that's very[1:08] different from what we have with HTML[1:10] where we have things like our nav our[1:12] header or footer or aside we have[1:13] figures we have all sorts of things that[1:16] have actual meaning to them and even[1:18] sometimes getting those right or using[1:19] them in the right way can has a little[1:21] bit of wiggle room but for the most part[1:23] it really makes our lives a lot easier[1:25] now the semantics of those elements help[1:27] convey actual meaning to the browser and[1:29] assistive Technologies as well but it[1:31] also makes it easy for developers to be[1:33] a bit more consistent and know how[1:35] things are being used so with all of[1:36] that how can we take that idea of[1:38] semantics from HTML and use them in CSS[1:41] without having to go down the route of[1:43] only selecting things like our nav or[1:45] header or footer with element selectors[1:47] so to figure that out we're going to[1:48] jump into this example that I have up[1:50] right now and this was heavily inspired[1:52] by an article that Ben Myers recently[1:54] put out so I will be linking to that in[1:55] the description I'd strongly recommend[1:57] giving it a read and I'll also have some[1:59] other good links down in the description[2:01] related to this topic that helped me put[2:03] this video together so the idea here is[2:06] this is quite a common thing that you[2:08] might see we have a current page like[2:10] this one so we have you know a regular[2:12] navigation set up with our semantic HTML[2:14] but then we have this current page here[2:16] and then of course it highlights the[2:18] page we're on so we just you know when[2:20] you go through all your different pages[2:21] you know if I'm on my about page I'm[2:23] just moving that down to there then I'm[2:24] moving that down to there and maybe[2:26] you're using some sort of dynamic system[2:28] to be able to do this with however[2:29] you're authoring you know depends on[2:31] your Tech stack and all of that but[2:32] we're highlighting the current page and[2:34] if we come back to the Styles here I've[2:36] just done this where I'm my nav link[2:38] that has a current page I've given it a[2:40] background color we're not doing[2:41] anything fancy here there's other ways[2:43] of doing this but a nice simple setup we[2:45] have a hover color for the regular one[2:47] and then we have this one one that has[2:49] the darker color and I've boosted[2:50] specificity on it to make sure that it's[2:52] working so if I hover on top of that one[2:54] we don't get the color changing nothing[2:56] too fancy but the one problem here is if[2:58] we come back to here we we've used our[3:00] nav here we've used a list here we're[3:01] using semantic elements but we're not[3:04] actually using anything semantic to link[3:06] into we're not we're not giving any[3:08] extra context to what the current page[3:10] is even though there is a way to do that[3:12] and the way to do that is an area[3:14] current equals page and by doing that[3:18] we're helping assistive Technologies get[3:20] the same hint that this is doing[3:22] visually on the page right here so right[3:25] away that's a good start but now I'm I[3:28] have this here and then I have the[3:30] current page here and that means if I go[3:33] and that you know I want to do my about[3:34] page now well that means I need to move[3:36] this thing here over down to here and[3:39] then I also need to remove this from[3:41] that link here and I do move that down[3:43] to the link here and there's a lot that[3:45] could potentially go wrong in having to[3:48] you know it's extra maintenance for[3:50] nothing it's kind of annoying on that[3:51] front and this is just some random class[3:54] that I've assigned to here this could[3:56] have been big butt like we mentioned[3:57] before and I could have it do the exact[3:59] same thing whereas this actually carries[4:01] meaning to it so if this actually[4:04] carries meaning to it and this is[4:05] actually saying this is the current page[4:07] that we're on right now well I could[4:09] hook into that with CSS so instead of[4:12] doing nav link current page like this I[4:14] could take this let's turn this into an[4:16] attribute selector by putting some[4:17] square brackets around it let's delete[4:19] what's in there and put in my area[4:21] current is equal to page[4:25] and hit save on that and now you can see[4:28] that it's still working and if we come[4:29] back to here and we delete this current[4:31] page from here and hit save[4:34] everything is still working perfectly[4:35] fine and what we've done here is[4:37] actually create a semantic CSS selector[4:39] we're using the semantics that we had in[4:41] our HTML without you know you could[4:43] select a nav a UL things like that but[4:45] we're linking into another level of[4:47] semantics and we're bringing that in[4:49] here to help style our page and that[4:52] means that things have to be done[4:53] properly from accessibility standpoint[4:55] to be able to style things so we're sort[4:57] of enforcing accessibility by doing this[5:00] as well because now if I go to my about[5:01] page it's broken because my about page[5:04] had it the old way[5:06] and I did this the old-fashioned way[5:08] with just some regular old C HTML on[5:11] every page so of course then this would[5:13] have to be removed and we do an area[5:15] current is equal to page right here and[5:18] now that's fixed and we have this[5:20] working across our pages and to be able[5:22] to do something like this requires[5:24] literally the exact same amount of work[5:27] as it would have required before the[5:29] only difference is it's a few extra[5:30] characters but the advantage is we're[5:32] bringing in[5:33] the accessibility component of it here[5:36] and we're just hooking into that with[5:38] our style sheet and how we're doing our[5:40] CSS right here to look at more examples[5:42] of types of things you can do with this[5:44] one I've looked at many times before is[5:46] using things like area expanded on[5:48] buttons for styling things like a[5:50] navigation whether it's opened or closed[5:52] so if we take a look at this when you're[5:55] doing it I have my button that's right[5:58] here we have an area expanded a false on[6:00] there and when it opens that gets[6:02] switched over to true so the JavaScript[6:04] is switching that back and forth between[6:06] the two of them but that means I can[6:08] hook in and I can style things from the[6:10] menu being open and what the menu looks[6:12] like to how my button is created and[6:15] everything using those selectors right[6:17] there another example could be down here[6:20] if you have a tabs system like this[6:22] where we can switch between different[6:24] tabs I could have everything controlled[6:27] through my area roles here that I'm[6:29] using for my tab list and things like[6:31] this that we should be setting up if[6:33] we're doing things this way so my tab[6:35] list is being set up through the role[6:37] I'm not coming up with a class and[6:38] having the role on there each tab is[6:41] being styled through that my tab panel[6:43] area selected is all coming together[6:46] here so when it's selected I'm changing[6:48] the style of it as I'm coming through on[6:50] those and if you're new to things like[6:52] this and you're not sure about them[6:53] anytime you're looking something up it's[6:55] very easy to do a nice quick search for[6:57] example let's say you need to make us an[6:59] on off switch for something you can just[7:01] do one for a11y switch and you can see I[7:04] was looking that up recently which is[7:06] why it's top of mind and you'll see lots[7:08] of different things that come up on it[7:09] and you can do some further reading on[7:11] it where a lot of the time they give you[7:13] code examples of what things are going[7:15] to look like including things like roles[7:18] that you might need to include so we[7:19] have the role of switch that are coming[7:21] on a few of these you'll see there's no[7:23] area anything but we do have the role of[7:24] switch there's other things that do come[7:26] up with these types of elements when[7:28] we're trying to make interactive[7:29] elements as accessible as possible and[7:31] that helps us hook into those with our[7:33] CSS and it helps us make our CSS[7:36] semantic as well and often the general[7:38] rule of area is don't use area if you[7:40] don't have to so just using your nav[7:42] your head or your footer things like[7:43] that are the right thing to do but as[7:45] soon as you are getting into more[7:46] complex things there are usually things[7:49] that you need to take into account and[7:51] it is really advantageous because it[7:53] makes it a lot easier to hook into[7:54] because an area selected true is nice[7:57] and you know you're not stuck thinking[7:59] do I need a tab tab opened or something[8:02] or is it opened or do I give this active[8:05] like what name do I give it you don't[8:06] have the whole worrying about how you[8:08] name things goes out the window it's[8:10] already handled for us we're good to go[8:11] and if you enjoyed this video and it[8:13] gave you a few thoughts I'd really[8:15] recommend checking out the articles that[8:16] you can see in the description that go[8:18] into a lot more detail and on a few of[8:20] the different patterns that you're[8:21] seeing here and if you're looking for[8:22] more video content I have looked at[8:24] another excessive ability issue that is[8:26] I see coming up all the time which is[8:28] the misuse of heading levels in putting[8:30] together websites and apps so if you're[8:32] curious about that that video is right[8:34] here for your viewing pleasure and with[8:35] that I would really like to thank my[8:37] enablers of awesome Jen Johnny Michael[8:39] Patrick Simon and Tim as well as all my[8:41] other patrons for their monthly support[8:42] and of course until next time don't[8:44] forget to make your corn on the internet[8:45] just a little bit more awesome", "length": 3752}

to\ncreate and build a strong personal brand\non and off social media so that you can\nhave a brand that creates impact or that\nbuilds your business or that just um\nachieve whatever goals you have for your\nown personal brand now one of the best\nthings that you can do and start doing\nimmediately is writing down your core\nvalues and these aren't just things that\nyou want people to receive from your\ncontent these are not tangible things\nthese are feelings you want to evoke\nfrom your audience or potential audience\nthrough your brand so these are three\nwords that I chose from my brand which\nare real I want people to feel that\nI'll just keep it real I want you to\nfeel like I am a real person that you\ncan relate to me and that you know I'm\njust like anybody else that's why my dad\nin the last videos he'll see me with no\nmakeup just like how I talk off camera\nit's how I talk to y'all on camera I\njust keep it real and I want my\ninformation to come across as genuine\nand real so real is definitely one of my\nmain values that gets top value that I\nhave is inviting so I want people to\nfeel like they are welcomes whether\nthat's through the camera whether I run\ninto a subscriber at the mall like I\njust did a couple days ago she was\nranking me up at the store for some\nclothes and literally like she was like\noh my gosh like I am a subscriber I\nreally love you and I just always want\npeople to feel like they are invited\ninto my space whether that's online or\nin person and even when I conduct\nbusiness being inviting is something\nthat I am just you know I give hugs I'm\njust that's me so inviting is a huge\nvalue of mine and then the third value\nvaluable okay so I always want to offer\nvalue to people even for free like on\nYouTube I like to give value on\nInstagram I like to give value and my\nstories Instagram stories I like to give\nvalue in person and people ask me\nquestions or you know whatever I'm\nalways trying to give as much value as I\ncan even in my business I've tried to\ngive people as much bang for their buck\nas they can so I always seem to over\ndeliver which is super super important\nto me so my three value is real inviting\nand valuable so start by picking three\nwords that you want your audience to\nfeel and you need to funnel every piece\nof content every interaction through\nthose values that needs to be a living\nbreathing part of you because your\npersonal brand ultimately is about what\nis important to you and how that is\nimportant to your audience the next\nthing that you should do in growing your\npersonal brand is pick two social media\nplatforms max to really put your energy\nin\n- so mie brand Club which is my\nmembership club for entrepreneurs or\ncontent creators looking to build their\nbrand and business I did a full\nhour-long lesson on which platforms\nshould you be on but I will give you a\nquick tip that I shared with my Club\npick two main social media platforms to\nchannel your energy into what you want\nto do is you want to pick one platform\nthat is more long-form so is long-form\ncontent where you can add value so that\nmight be YouTube videos that may be\npodcasting that may be long-form\nFacebook videos blog posts so pick one\nplatform that adds high value then a\nsecondary platform that adds high\nengagement so this is where you engage\nheavily with your your followers and you\nbegin building those relationships and\nthat is like the perfect duo so this\nmight be Twitter you may love to tweet\nit you might have a way with words or\nsuper witty and so you might and you\nmight be great on camera so maybe you\nhave YouTube as more of your long-form\ncontent and then you have Twitter as\nyour secondary content and you kind of\ntag-team the two platforms and it just\nkind of creates this really clean\necosystem you're not pushing people to\nInstagram into into Facebook and to\nYouTube and to podcast you give them two\nmain places to live and to really build\nthose communities so I find that that's\na really really great way to brand\nyourself personally is not trying to\nfocus on so many social media platforms\nnot trying to grow all of your platforms\nbut really zeroing in on two platforms\nthat are really going to help you build\nyour audience where where one offers\nhigh value the other offers high\nengagement and strong relationship\nbuilding BAM the next thing is to be\nclear and to be consistent now what I\nfind a lot of entrepreneurs have an\nissue with is being clear and what they\ndo the services they offer who they're\noffering those services to and how they\nhelp that person a lot of people don't\neven know how to explain their business\nand\nshort and sweet way which is super super\nimportant so the first thing is being\nclear on the purpose of your brand the\nsecond part of that is being consistent\nrepetition is key now this is where\nthose graphics and colors and those\nthings can come into play where you're\nconstantly putting out content and it's\nlike a certain format that is great\nbranding people can recognize you from\nthose colors they know automatically\nthat this is an airing video because I\nknow what her thumbnails look like or I\nknow whatever that this is her color\nthat is a great you know aspect of\npersonal branding and you should be\nconsistent in the way that you present\nyourself graphically but also it's\nimportant to be consistent and the way\nthat you present yourself personally and\nI have dealt with businesses where their\nsocial media looks amazing they you know\nthey make themselves out to be this pop\nin you know entrepreneur or hustler or\nsod house or whatever and then I try to\nsupport and I order something and the\ncustomer service is terrible or you know\nI don't get my order and X amount of\ntime or you know it's just the personal\nbrand doesn't carry all the way through\nto the end of my transaction and so you\nalways want to make sure that you are\nconsistent with your brand not just\ngraphically and on social media and\nthrough your colors and your your your\ngraphic branding but also through your\nhuman interactions your customer service\nthat is very very important that these\ncore values don't just live on social\nmedia but they live in your day to day\nlife\nnow let's talk about quality over\nquantity\nit is so important you guys to have\nquality supporters than a lot of non\nquality supporters a lot of people get\nreally caught up in vanity metrics you\nwant a certain amount of followers or a\ncertain amount of subscribers and I know\none of my goals for the end of the year\nis to get 50,000 subscribers but I\nunderstand that it is not just about the\nsubscribe\nthat matters it's about having loyal\nloyal supporters there is a concept\ncalled the 1,000 true fans by Kevin\nKelley and basically he breaks down how\nall you need to really make a living is\na thousand true fans so if you are\nselling like my a brand club for example\nit is $20 a month if there were a\nthousand people in that club that would\nbe twenty thousand dollars a month\nall you need is one thousand royal\nsubscribers those people who write for\nyou or first to comment on your videos\nwho are first to buy something from you\nyou don't need to focus so much on\nhaving more people you just need to\nfocus way more on having more quality\npeople and building the followers that\nyou have in to those people who want to\nyou know be super loyal to you the next\ntip in building your personal brand is\nnot to just talk to welcome not to just\nsuck the suck but to walk the walk and I\nthink that this is probably the most\nchallenging thing for people nowadays\nbecause social media has given us a way\nto push out our personal brands even if\nit's not something that we truly believe\nin or you know is authentically us so\nthere are a lot of people perpetrating\nout here and putting up personal brands\nand trying to get the audience their\naudiences to perceive a certain thing\nabout them I mean that's not actually\nhow they are okay let me know if you\ndon't dealt with some of that before\nbecause anyway if you cannot send a\nfollow-up email if you cannot have great\ncustomer service\nif you cannot truly come through the way\nthat you make yourself out to on social\nmedia then that is not your personal\nbrand boo boo and you can really really\ntarnish your brand and your reputation\nif you don't follow through with image\nthat you are creating for yourself on\nsocial media the next thing you need to\ndo is know your audience like this is so\nimportant because even though this is\nyour personal brand and these are things\nthat are valuable to you\nyou're still trying to you know attract\na certain type of person so you need to\nknow what\ntype of person looks like if you are\nsuper into traveling and your brand is\nlike all about traveling to little known\nplaces so not like super touristy places\nbut you're you want to travel to places\nthat nobody really goes to your target\naudience is probably going to be some\nreally avid travelers and so you want to\nmake sure that the content that you're\nputting out talks to them a big part of\nthis is really knowing yourself before\nyou pick an audience that you want to\ncater to because you want to know like\nWho am I and what is it that I want the\nworld to know before you start picking\nwho you're targeting because you don't\nwant to lose yourself and your sense of\nauthenticity because you're trying so\nhard to appeal to this specific\ndemographic so a lot of it is gonna be\nthose core values that set you apart\nfrom other people who are in that niche\nor doing those things or who have a\nsimilar personal brand to you so a big\nthing is knowing your audience but know\nyourself before you start trying to\nhandpick the audience that you're trying\nto attract last thing is to just be\nyourself Quincy you've got to just be\nyourself and really not focus so much on\nall of the little things I think in\nbranding the little things are your logo\nyour colors all of those things they are\nvery important but they're not as\nimportant as your authenticity your core\nvalues the information that you're\ngiving to people you know how you want\npeople to feel how you tell better\nstories in and get your impact to more\npeople the little things that you can\nchange and you know switch up are your\nlogo your name like those are things\nthat you honestly can change and rebrand\nbut who you are and the message that you\nwant to give to the world is not\nsomething that you can just constantly\nchange the only way that cream\na personal brand is constantly gonna be\nfun and enjoyable is if it truly depicts\nwho you are it can become very tiresome\nto create these videos and to post\ncertain types of pictures on Instagram\nand to put on this facade online when\nthat's not who you are in person and\nhonestly when people do meet you in\nperson it can be a huge letdown because\nthey're expecting you to be a certain\nway just make sure that everything is\naligned and that who you are is at the\nforefront of what your brand is and what\nhow you shape your personal brand to be\nyes it can be you know one aspect of you\nmaybe you love to travel and you love to\ncook and you love fashion but you want\nyour personal brand to focus more on\ntraveling because you want to come out\nwith a travel bag someday and or you\nwant to curate trips for people and you\nknow that's the thing that you focus on\nthat's totally fine but make sure that\nthat is genuine and that is not\nsomething that's forced so there we go\nthose are my personal branding tips and\nif you want more tips on branding\nbuilding your business you are welcome\nto subscribe one and two to join my a\nbrand Club it is an awesome community\nfor entrepreneurs and content creators\nlooking to really take their

{"prompt": "Please write a Conclusion with a Recap of key takeaways and\n\u2022 Resources for further reading and support. Here is text that requires a conclusion: Developing a Business Idea\nAre you ready to turn your passion into a successful business? Well, you've come to the right place. In this chapter, we're going to take a deep dive into the process of developing a strong business idea.\nWe all know that a solid business idea is the foundation of any successful venture. But where do great business ideas come from? How can you turn your passion and skills into a profitable business? That's what we're here to explore.\nWe'll start by talking about how to identify your passions and skills and how they can be used to start a business. Then, we'll explore strategies for identifying a problem to solve and building a business model that aligns with your idea.\nWe'll also cover the importance of developing a business plan, testing and validating your idea, and identifying potential risks and challenges. Let's get started!\nIdentifying Your Passion and Skills\nIdentifying your passions is an essential step in developing a winning business idea. It is important to take the time to reflect on what activities and subjects you enjoy, that you would be willing to spend a significant amount of time and energy on and that align with your values and objectives.\nTo begin identifying your passions, make a list of activities and subjects that interest you. Think about what makes you excited and motivated. Reflect on what you would be willing to spend hours doing without getting tired. Consider what you would be passionate about even if you were not getting paid for it.\nOnce you have a list of activities and subjects that you are passionate about, narrow it down to the top three to five that stand out the most. These passions can serve as the foundation for your business idea.\nBy identifying your passions, you will be able to develop a business idea that is not only fulfilling for you but also has the potential to be successful.\nAssessing your skills and experience is another important step in developing a winning business idea. Your skills and experience are the tools that you'll use to turn your passion into a profitable business.\nTo begin assessing your skills and experience, make a list of the knowledge, skills, and experiences you have gained through your education, work, and personal experiences. Think about what you are good at, what you are not good at and what you're willing to learn. Then consider how your skills and experience can be used to start and run a business. For example, if you have a background in marketing, you may want to start a business that focuses on marketing services. If you have experience in finance, you may want to start a business that focuses on financial consulting.\nIt's also important to consider the skills and experience that you lack and how you can acquire them. For example, if you don't have experience in sales, you may want to take the initiative to learn and understand the sales aspect of running a business by reading, taking a course or hiring a consultant.\nUnderstanding the intersection between your passion, skills, and the market is crucial to developing a winning business idea. Your passion and skills can be used to identify potential opportunities in the market. By understanding how your passions and skills align with market needs, you can develop a business idea that is not only fulfilling for you but also has the potential to be successful.\nTo begin understanding the intersection between your passion, skills, and the market, start by conducting market research. Research the industry and the market to understand what products or services are in demand, what the current trends are and what the potential opportunities are. Look for gaps in the market that you can fill with your passion and skills.\nNext, evaluate the potential of your business idea. Consider the size of the market, the competition, and the profitability of the market. Assess whether there is a need for your product or service and whether there is enough demand to sustain your business.\nIt's also important to consider the scalability of your business idea. Can your business idea grow and expand as the market changes? Is it adaptable to the changing market trends?\nIn conclusion, understanding the intersection between your passion, skills, and the market is crucial to developing a winning business idea. By conducting market research, evaluating the potential of your business idea and considering the scalability of your business, you can develop a business idea that has the potential to be successful and sustainable in the long term.\n\nIdentifying a Problem to Solve\nIdentifying a problem to solve or a need to fill in the market is an important step in developing a winning business idea. By understanding the importance of solving a problem or filling a need, you can create a product or service that addresses a specific need in the market. This can help increase the chances of success for your business.\nWhen you identify a problem or need, you are creating a solution for a specific group of people or businesses. By addressing a specific problem or need, you are able to target a specific market, which can increase the chances of success for your business.\nAdditionally, identifying a problem or need allows you to create a unique selling point for your business. Instead of competing with businesses that have a similar product or service, you are able to differentiate yourself by offering a solution to a specific problem or need.\nIt's also important to understand that solving a problem or filling a need in the market can also lead to repeat customers and positive word-of-mouth. When you solve a problem or fill a need, you are creating a solution that can be beneficial to your customers, and therefore, they are more likely to return and recommend your business to others.\n\nIdentifying potential problems or needs in your industry\nTo begin identifying potential problems or needs in your industry, conduct market research. Research the industry and the market to understand what products or services are in demand, what the current trends are, and what the potential opportunities are. Look for gaps in the market that you can fill with your product or service. Don\u2019t worry; we\u2019ll discuss market research in greater detail in the next chapter!\nAnother way to identify potential problems or needs in your industry is by talking to potential customers or industry experts. Reach out to individuals or businesses in your target market and ask them about their pain points and what they need. This can help you identify a specific problem that needs to be solved or a need that needs to be filled.\nYou can also look for industry publications, online forums, and social media groups that discuss problems and needs in your industry. This can give you an idea of the challenges that people in your industry face and the areas where there is a lack of solutions.\nIt's also important to stay up to date with the latest industry trends and developments. This can help you identify potential problems or needs before they become widespread.\nBuilding a Business Model\nBuilding a business model is a crucial step in developing a winning business idea. A business model is a blueprint for how your business will create, deliver, and capture value. By understanding different types of business models and how they can be applied to your idea, you can create a sustainable and profitable business.\nThere are many different types of business models available, each with its own unique characteristics and benefits. Here are some of the most common types of business models and their key features:\n1. Product/Service model: This is the most common business model, where a business sells a product or a service to customers. It's a straightforward model that's easy to understand and implement.\n2. Advertising model: This model is where a business generates revenue by displaying ads on its platform or product. This model is often used by websites, social media platforms, and other online businesses.\n3.

This model is popular among software and app developers, where users can try the basic version before purchasing the full version.\n4.

Affiliate model: This model is where a business earns revenue by promoting or selling other businesses' products or services. This model is often used by companies that operate websites or other platforms where they can promote products or services from other businesses.\n7. Sharing economy model: This model is where a business allows customers to share or rent assets. This model is often used by companies that provide car-sharing or vacation rental services.\n8. Franchise model: This model is where a business licenses its brand and business model to other businesses. This model is often used by companies that have a well-established brand and want to expand their reach without the costs and risks associated with opening new locations.\n9. Platform model: This model is where a business creates a platform that connects buyers and sellers, such as an e-commerce website. Platform businesses typically make money by charging a transaction fee or by providing advertising space.\n10. Licensing model: This model is where a business earns revenue by licensing its technology or other intellectual property to other businesses. This model is often used by companies that have developed a proprietary technology or other intellectual property that they can license to other businesses.\nTo apply a business model to your idea, it's important to understand your target market, your unique value proposition, and your revenue streams. A revenue stream is the way a business generates income from its operations. Some common revenue streams include product sales, service sales, advertising, subscription, affiliate, licensing, pay-what-you-want, and crowdfunding. By understanding the different types of revenue streams available and how they can be applied to your idea, you can develop a clear plan for how your business will generate income and make a profit.\nOnce you have a solid understanding of your business model and potential revenue streams, it's important to develop a financial plan and projections. A financial plan includes a budget, projected income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement, and helps you to understand the financial requirements and potential profitability of your business. Projections are estimates of future financial performance and are important in determining the feasibility of your business. These projections can be done using different methods and tools like financial forecasting, breakeven analysis, and sensitivity analysis to name a few.\nBuilding a business model, identifying potential revenue streams, and developing a financial plan and projections are essential steps in creating a sustainable and profitable business that addresses the needs of your target market and generates a steady revenue stream. It will also give you a better understanding of the finances of the business and help you make better decisions for the future. It's also important to note that a business model can evolve over time. As your business grows, you may need to adjust your business model to fit the changing market conditions.\nTesting and Validating Your Idea\n\nTesting and validating your idea is an essential step in the business development process. It helps you to understand the potential of your idea, identify any weaknesses, and make informed decisions about its viability.\nOne of the most important methods for testing and validating your idea is market research. Market research is the process of gathering and analyzing data about your target market, competitors, and industry trends. It helps you to understand your target market's needs, preferences, and pain points, as well as identify potential opportunities in the market.\nAnother effective method for testing and validating your idea is customer interviews. Customer interviews are a great way to get feedback on your idea from potential customers. They can help you to understand how your idea will be received in the market, and identify any areas where it can be improved.\nPrototyping is another method for testing and validating your idea. A prototype is a basic version of your product or service that you can use to test its functionality and usability. It helps you to understand how your idea will work in practice, and identify any problems that need to be addressed.\nAfter you've collected data and feedback through market research, customer interviews, and prototyping, it's important to analyze the data and feedback. This will help you to understand the potential of your idea, identify any weaknesses, and make informed decisions about its viability. \nIt's also important to remember that testing and validating your idea is an ongoing process. As you continue to develop and grow your business, you should continue to gather and analyze data and feedback to ensure that your idea remains viable and relevant in the market.\n\nIdentifying potential risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges can come in many forms, such as financial risks, market risks, operational risks, and regulatory risks, and it's important to identify them early on, so you can develop a plan to mitigate them and minimize their impact on your business.\nOne way to identify potential risks and challenges is through a risk management process. This process involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks and developing a plan to mitigate them. This can include creating a risk register, which is a document that lists identified risks and their potential impact on the business.\nAnother way to identify potential risks and challenges is through a SWOT analysis. A SWOT analysis is a tool that helps you to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of your business, and it can help you to identify potential risks and challenges, such as market competition, regulatory changes, and economic downturns.\nOnce potential risks and challenges have been identified, it's important to develop a plan to mitigate them. This may include developing contingencies, such as backup plans or insurance coverage, and implementing risk management procedures and protocols, such as regular risk assessments and crisis management plans.\nSummary\nTesting and validating your idea is not only about gathering feedback and analyzing data, but also about identifying potential risks and challenges, and developing a plan to mitigate them. By identifying potential risks and challenges early on, you can minimize the impact of these risks on your business and increase the chances of success. Risk management process and SWOT analysis are effective tools to help identify potential risks and challenges and developing a plan to mitigate them. It's important to have contingencies and risk management procedures in place to minimize the impact of risks and challenges on your business.", "length": 3269}
{"prompt": "Generate an improved response to the following prompt from the perspective of a high school math teacher. \n\nresponse: My district does not have a SLO ( student learning objective) process. There is School Improvement Plan (SIP) however that team did not have any teachers on the team. The school\u2019s goal is to have 95% of 9th graders on track for graduation and for school wide attendance to be over 85%. Math curriculum teams of a few teachers meet over the summer to create unit plans for the upcoming school year however the units are rarely looked at during the school year. I would improve our SLO process by making one. Have teachers and administrators come together to make goals for each grade level in english and in math. I would also have quarterly progress monitoring checkins with data analysis for progress towards the goal. \n\nEnd response with apa 7 works cited with link to video\n\nPrompt:\nWatch the Student Learning Objectives video and reflect on your school\u2019s SLO process. Is your school using the SLO process in a way that benefits teachers and students? What in the video spoke to you? If you were in charge of revising the SLO process at your school, what would you change? Why? \n\nVideo url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-9\\_J1eJO8E&ab\\_channel=MCPSTV\nSLO Video transcript:\n\nLoretta Woods: An SLO is a formal way to capture what skillful teachers and leaders already do. It allows\n0:12\nthem to look the gaps that students have and work collaboratively to try to close that\n0:17\ngap. So this is a tool for equity because you don't look at a group of students and\n0:23\nassume. You use data to support it, and then you set measurable targets. You help kids\n0:30\nmake implementable growth based on what the data says. Gary Bartee: It personalizes the gaps that we\n0:35\nhave in our schools, those kids that aren't making progress, and it takes the data from\n0:41\nnumbers form to real life face. Dorthea Fuller: It did help us look at students a little differently and\n0:48\nlook at what we were doing differently. Teachers have to see that this purposeful; it is not just\n0:54\nanother thing to do, it connects with the work the are already doing. So we took and provided\n1:00\ntime for teachers to come together to collaborate, to decide as a team what would be an important\n1:09\nstudent learning objective. And then to decide individually what the needs were in their classroom.\n1:16\nLoretta Woods: If a teacher is having a hard time with their SLOs , they turn to their team\n1:22\nat their schools to help support them.\n1:26\nJennifer Webster: As a principal, I think it important that I have structures in place to provide teacher that support, to collaborate, to make meaning of\n1:31\nwhat research says about good teaching, how to reach kids who aren't achieving, and that\n1:36\nwe make the SLO an evolving, living document. I see the SLO as really, very closely aligned\n1:42\nwith our school improvement work; not something extra to be done. So for us , SLOs are a\n1:47\ntopic of every other rolling meeting we have. It is very embedded into the work we're doing,\n1:53\nso that no one out there on their own trying to figure it out.\n1:58\nDavid Culpepper: Once a week we meet to discuss the process of SLO's, how were progressing, any problems we are running into or questions\n2:04\nwe may have. For teachers, the SLO fosters risk-taking to get you a little bit out of your comfort zone and try\n2:10\nto take a lesson that you've done over and over again to see if you can do it totally differently\n2:16\nand get better results. There is a similar component to National Board Certification where you have\n2:21\nstudents that you track, you track their progress and you try to make sure that you are focusing on what\n2:27\nworks for them.\n2:28\nJennifer Webster: The SLO does help teachers to chunk and break down their planning to think about what are the most important things that I need to students to know and be able to do in my course.\n2:39\nLoretta Woods: Teachers and leaders are growing and learning and perfecting their craft.\n2:52\nTraci Townsend: So we always have a conversation with teachers so that we can talk about their decision making and\n2:55\nthe groups they decided to focus on. So it is definitely a collaborative effort.\n3:03\nDana Sturdivant: The SLO in my self contained math class is looking at our school focus which is writing.\n3:06\nSpecifically, I'm looking for students to be able to make a mathematically viable claim in their writing.\n3:10\nI think because of the SlO's teachers are more aware of students strengths and weaknesses\n3:16\nand specific strategies they can use to target certain groups of student.\n3:24\nRobert Randolph: One of my SLOs is for my children to essentially compose a paragraph in which they have a topic sentence,\n3:29\ntwo to three detail sentences and one closing summary statement. I chose that particular\n3:33\ngoal because I recognize severe writing deficits in my students, particularly four of my young\n3:40\nmen who have a tendency to compose run on sentences. Some of the strategies I'm utilizing\n3:45\nwith my identified students would be, for example, using a graphic organizer, which allows\n3:50\nthem to break down this paragraph into components.\n3:57\nAngela Sebring: I think it kind of critical when you go to write an SLO and how you carry out an SLO is that you're working with other people in the building\n4:00\nand your talking to other people in the building. It helps me to give focus for the year. So\n4:05\nwhat am I gonna do this year, how am I gonna get these students to understand this concept.\n4:10\nI'm coming up with these different strategies that will really help them understand what\n4:13\ndoes clockwise mean, where does it come from. And when your focused on something, it really\n4:18\nhelps you to get better strategies out of it.\n4:24\nDenise Rodriquez: As an ESOL teacher, I chose a small group of 1st graders, and I had two SLOs - the first one was related to analyzing the vocabulary\n4:33\nwords in the question that directly relates to our SIP. And its our whole instructional focus.\n4:42\nSo wasn't something more than we do here, it is what we do here.\n4:51\nAudrey Lubitz: I work with a group of four other algebra teachers, we got a professional development day to sit down as a group, think about our\n4:55\nstudents. We use data from a pre -assessment that we created. So the goal was to have students\n5:02\ngraph and interpret the graph of the linear function. Once we landed on our SLO goal, we\n5:08\nlooked up different online resources that we can use to support our students and support\n5:13\nus in teaching the students. Doing the SLO has made me a better teacher now because I\n5:19\nreally forced to think about my teaching and think about how am I helping the students;\n5:25\nwhat am I actually doing to make them improve.\n5:33\nAshley tauber: Every Friday we listen to a different type of music and they've been writing feedback about what they hear and they're not\n5:38\nreally using music specific vocabulary that they know, but they're not applying it when\n5:43\nthey're writing in their listening log. So I've been working with our staff development\n5:47\nteacher to build some vocabulary lessons to work on, some worksheets for the students.\n5:52\nIt definitely made me a better teacher to work on an SLO because I'm trying to find\n5:57\ndifferent ways to access my students.\n6:03\nAmail Panakure: When you go through this entire process and you have some students, some of your targeted students reach their goal\n6:06\nand some fall a little shortof doing so, it makes you really reflective and focused. As a teacher our goal is for\n6:12\nall of our students to be successful, and the SLO is merely a tool to help them get there.\n6:20\nKristina Hawkes: Here at Longview, we have students who have severe profound and multiple disabilities.\n6:22\nI wrote my SLO for this year with my teammates Selena and also Lisa .\n6:30\nMy SLO goal this year is for students to increase their functional receptive vocabulary by 1 or more words.\n6:32\nNone of our students have speech or sign. So we use assistive technology. We use objects as much as\n6:37\nwe can. Having this SLO has help me become a more careful planner. Its helping me focus\n6:42\non making sure that I am purposely and carefully planning in opportunities to teach the vocabulary.\n6:52\nNorman Coleman: As a principal, when it comes to SLOs, we have to do the same thing that teachers do.\n6:54\nWe really have to have a focus group of individuals students that we're looking at.\n6:57\nThis year I'm focusing on 1st grade students, African American males and Hispanic males and their\n7:01\nachievement areas of reading and mathematics.\n7:11\nMaria Boichin: The SLO is a process, and it starts with determiningfinding your group of students which need you most. The idea is that what is good for that\n7:16\ngroup of students will be ultimately good for everybody else. The main focus of the\n7:21\nSLO is the reflection. We are wanting to reflect on our practices, what worked, what needs\n7:26\nimproving, how am I going to do it differently next time.\n7:30\nDavid Culpepper: My reflections on my teaching tend to be more general. It is working for the class and the whole 90% of the students are getting\n7:39\nit, you know that seems like a good job, but if 90% of the students are getting it that\n7:44\nmeans that there 2 or 3 that aren't. And so the SLO really makes you stop and think about\n7:49\nthose 2 or 3 people who aren't getting it and think about what might you try differently.\n7:54\nJennifer Webser: It about reflecting on your practice and trying something that is new to you. If your SLO reflects\n8:01\nwhat you've done to tweak and reflect and the growth you've had, then you've written a wonderful\n8:06\nSLO. It is not always about the results. It is about the process, and the results merely inform\n8:12\nour next steps.\n8:16\nAmali Panakure: We shared ideas with each other. We reflected. It really was a great opportunity for us to build our school community also.\n8:26\nDenise Rodriguez: The SLO process has made it easier for us to be able to say I tried this and it didn't work - because if something doesn't\n8:31\nwork then I feel like somebody else has another strategy that I can use.\n8:36\nGary Bartee: We move form an isolated format of close your door and work in this environment to really having conversations\n8:42\nabout what is our collective responsibility. It not just about my class and my kids, but\n8:47\nit about all of our children and how do we support each other in terms of achieving that.\n8:52\nLoretta Woods: The SLO is a learning opportunity for teachers and what it does for students is\n8:57\nthat it helps them reach their full potential.\n9:00\nAmali Panakure: When you're actually meeting the needs of your students and they're becoming more proficient, it really builds their confidence and I think\n9:08\nit puts students a lot more at ease. So I have definitely have seen a change, a more positive\n9:13\nattitude in a lot of our students.\n9:16\nDorthea Fuller: Anytime we focus in on students' needs, and we are very targeted and specific, we close the achievement gap.\n9:25\nGary Bartee: SLOs help you focus on the work that we're called to do.", "length": 3104}

{"prompt": "1. It's not about what you can't do, but what you can do.\n\nStephen Hawking once said, \"However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the things we can't do, the obstacles that stand in our way. But that mindset limits us and prevents us from reaching our full potential.\n\nInstead, focus on what you can do and what you are capable of achieving. It may require a change in perspective or a different approach, but success is within reach.\n\n[Transition to specific strategies or tools that readers can use to overcome limitations and achieve their goals.]\n\n2.

Life is a journey, not a destination.\n\nAs Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"Life is a journey, not a destination.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the end goal, the destination we want to reach.

It's not about being perfect, it's about being authentic.\n\nAs Maya Angelou said, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\"\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in trying to be perfect, in trying to impress others. But in the end, it's about being true to yourself and being authentic.\n\nIt's about connecting with others and making a positive impact, not about being flawless. So don't be afraid to be yourself and let your true personality shine.\n\n[Transition to how readers can be authentic in their journey towards achieving their goals, and how that authenticity can help them connect with others and achieve success.]\n\n5. The secret to success is in small, consistent steps.\nAs Lao Tzu said, \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\"\n\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed by the enormity of our goals, but the key to success is in taking small, consistent steps towards them.\n\nIt's not about the destination, it's about the journey.

So don't let fear hold you back, take the first step towards your dream.\n\n[Transition to how readers can overcome fear and pursue their goals.]\n\n7. Embrace change and uncertainty as a part of the journey.\n\nAs Steve Jobs said, \"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.\"\n\nChange and uncertainty are a natural part of life, and they can often be uncomfortable. \nBut it's important to remember that these experiences shape us and help us grow.\n\nEmbrace change and uncertainty as a part of the journey, and trust that the dots will connect in the end.\n\n[Transition to how readers can navigate change and uncertainty in order to achieve their goals.]\n\n8. The road to success is not a straight path.\n\nAs Mark Twain said, \"The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.\"\n\nThe road to success is not a straight path, it's filled with twists and turns.

Stop living in the past\u2026\nAs the famous philosopher, Socrates said, \u201cThe past is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the present.\u201d\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the past and let it define us, but we must remember that the past is gone and we cannot change it.\n\nThe same applies to the future, we can't predict it, we can only plan for it.\n\nSo stop living in the past and start living in the present. Make the most of the present moment, and use it to work towards your goals.\n\n[Transition to how readers can focus on the present and use it to achieve their goals.]\n\n12.

Don't be afraid to fail\u2026\nAs Michael Jordan said, \u201cI\u2019ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I\u2019ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times \nI\u2019ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I\u2019ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.\u201d\n\nFailure is a natural part of the journey towards success, and it's important to remember that it's not about never failing, it's about learning from our failures and using them to grow and improve.\n\nDon't be afraid to fail, embrace it as a part of the journey.\n\n[Transition to how readers can learn from their failures and use them to achieve their goals.]\n\n15.

{"prompt": "explain in detail the summary of this paper in no less than 1000 words? ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) imposes a major burden on global public health which is exacerbated by the escalating number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. There is consequently an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. We have investigated the natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) for repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Here, we report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. Moreover, the FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCombination therapy is essential to the clinical management of tuberculosis (TB) disease (1). Until recently, strategies to identify and advance promising combinations during early-stage pre-clinical TB drug discovery were limited. However, growing recognition of the need to identify new anti-TB drugs and regimens has re-focused attention on early-stage pre-clinical identification of synergizing combination partners for potential development (2), including drugs which are not clinically effective against TB (3, 4).\n\nAs part of a drug repurposing strategy, we utilized fusidic acid (FA) as anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combination(s) that might be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy. FA, a translational inhibitor with demonstrated (albeit moderate) activity in vitro (5, 6), was selected owing to its unique mechanism of action: specifically, inhibition of mycobacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) (7). The antimicrobial-potentiating effect of FA with other antibiotics including the frontline anti-TB drug, ethambutol (EMB), as well as its lack of cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes, provided additional motivation for our choice of FA (8, 9). In this short report, we present the analysis of in vitro interactions between FA and partner compounds comprising drugs currently used in TB treatment and selected translational inhibitors, the latter selected to enable evaluation the effects of combining FA with drugs acting on the same pathway (Fig. 1), (10, 11).\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nAntibiotic targets in protein synthesis:\nSchematic representation indicating known and predicted target sites of antibiotics disrupting different stages in the (myco)bacterial translation pathway. The tRNA binding sites - amino acid (A), peptide (P), and exit (E) - on the ribosome are indicated. Adopted and modified from Wilson et al. (10).\n\nRESULTS\nCheckerboard assay identifies synergistic drug combination partners for fusidic acid\nTo identify potential partners of FA, our preliminary screens utilized Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, a fast-growing, non-pathogenic mycobacterium which has been exploited as a useful surrogate in drug efficacy studies in vitro. In standard two-drug checkerboard experiments (Table S1), SPC, ERY, CLR and TET exhibited synergy with FA, defined as FICI \u2264 0.5. These combinations displayed a 4-to 16-fold reduction in MIC90 for each of the individual drugs (Fig. S1). No antagonistic effects were observed with any of the combinations tested.\n\nThe synergies detected in M. smegmatis informed subsequent selection of combination partners for evaluation in M. tuberculosis using the checkerboard method. In addition, representative drugs consisting of clinically used anti-TB agents (first- and second-line) and selected translational inhibitors were tested in combination with FA. For these assays, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv reporter strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used, as described previously (12). Fig. S2 provides an example of an interaction study in which FA and ERY were analysed in the checkerboard assay. Results in Table 1 show similarity to those obtained for M. smegmatis, such that SPC, ERY and CLR exhibited synergy with FA against M. tuberculosis. The combination of FA and ERY returned a FICI value of 0.25, indicating a synergistic interaction (Fig. S2A). Other drugs that synergized with FA included RIF, STR, roxithromycin (ROX), and LZD. These synergistic interactions generally resulted in 4-to 8-fold reductions in the MICs of each drug within the combination. Even though the combination of FA and BDQ did not result in a FICI value of \u2264 0.5, it is important to note that the two displayed approximately a 4-fold reduction in their respective MICs, and the observed FICI (0.55) was very close to that defined as \u201csynergy\u201d. No antagonistic interaction was observed between FA and any of the compounds tested. For the combinations exhibiting synergy with FA, isobolograms were constructed by plotting the FIC curves of the FA-drug combinations (Fig. S3). Interactions between FA and ERY, SPC, and RIF were well within the synergy region (FICI < 0.5) whereas FA with STR, LZD, and ROX indicated borderline synergy (FICI = 0.5). The FA-INH interaction was included as a \u201cno interaction\u201d control.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nIn vitro synergistic interaction between FA and anti TB agents or selected translational inhibitors against M. tuberculosis::gfp\n\nTo confirm results obtained using the checkerboard assay, the strongly synergistic FA-ERY combination was evaluated in a growth inhibition assay (Fig. S4). For this purpose, FA and ERY were used at 0.3 and 27 \u00b5M, respectively, since these were the concentrations at which the lowest FICI value was obtained in the checkerboard assay (Fig. S2). RIF, at a concentration of 0.015 \u00b5M, was included as a control. In the absence of drug, the population of M. tuberculosis increased over 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the population of viable cells remained relatively constant over the same duration when the growth medium contained the FA and ERY combination. Similarly, the medium containing FA, ERY plus sub-MIC RIF did not display any increase in the number of viable bacterial population over a 14-day period. In contrast, cultures incubated in the presence of the individual antibiotics, FA or ERY, showed equivalent growth to the untreated control.\n\nAssessing synergistic and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FA synergizing drugs for optimal therapy\nAs a key consideration for the clinical potential of FA combinations, the respective concentrations at which synergy was observed were compared with the reported peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) for each drug. This is important in understanding whether the concentrations required to achieve the desired response are therapeutically feasible \u2013 and, consequently, whether the results obtained from an in vitro assay have any utility in guiding therapeutic use. Except for the FA-ERY interaction, synergies between FA and its partners were achieved at concentrations predicted to be below the maximum plasma concentrations (13, 14), suggesting that these concentrations are therapeutically achievable (Fig. S5). For example, the presence of FA decreased the MIC of SPC from 201 \u00b5M to 3.14 \u00b5M, which represents a greater than 98% reduction in the MIC (Table S2). This reduced concentration is far below the Cmax value of SPC in humans (30.8 \u00b5M), determined following a 1000 mg intramuscular dose (15).\n\nAssessing cidal versus static synergies\nTo determine whether FA interactions resulted in killing or merely inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, the method of Zhang et al. was utilized (16). INH, a bactericidal agent, was used as a reference drug, and all drugs were tested alone and in combination against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp bioreporter strain. Results for the bacteriostatic or cidal effects of the drug combinations with FA are illustrated (Figure 2). The FA-RIF combination displayed a MBC/MIC ratio of \u2264 2 on day 14 of evaluation, suggesting cidality. The other combinations tested \u2013 combining FA with SPC, ERY, CLR, ROX or LZD \u2013 all exhibited MBC/MIC ratios >2, implying static effects. The bacteriostatic/cidal action of individual drugs is shown in Fig. S6.\n\nFigure 2.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 2.\nBactericidal versus static effects of drug combinations against M. tuberculosis.\nAnalysis of FA in combination with synergizing drugs; ERY, SPC, CLR, ROX, RIF, and LZD.

Error bars indicate standard deviations, calculated from the mean of triplicate samples.\n\nFA synergizing partners are active against the FA-resistant mutant\nA cross-resistance study was performed using a FA-resistant M. tuberculosis mutant carrying H462Y mutation in fusA1(11). The FA-resistant mutant exhibited >100-fold MIC compared to the FA-susceptible parental strain. Six synergistic FA partner drugs \u2013 RIF, SPC, CLR, ERY, STR and ROX \u2013 were evaluated using the resazurin reduction microplate assay (REMA). The results (Fig. S7) indicated that the MIC90 values of these drugs remained the same against the FA-resistant mutant relative to the wild-type strain, confirming that there was no cross-resistance to each of the tested compounds.\n\nInteraction of FA synergizing partners with selected chemically unrelated compounds\nUsing a set of six chemically and structurally diverse drug agents (Table S3), a combination assay was performed with four drugs that had displayed synergistic interaction with FA: RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC. The aim was to determine whether these compounds displayed synergy only with FA or exhibited a wider spectrum of synergistic interactions. The results of these pairwise combinations (Figure 3) revealed potentiating interactions between all FA synergizing partners (except RIF) and THS, BDQ and CPZ. CLR displayed strong synergies with BDQ and CPZ (FICI = 0.23 in both cases). The interaction between SPC and INH was also synergistic, while the remaining compounds (EMB and MOX) exhibited no interactions in combination with RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC.\n\nFigure 3.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nDrug interaction study.\nPairwise interactions between selected drugs (blue fonts) and synergizing agents (black fonts) of FA (using M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp.

For example, in the interaction between RIF and MOX, top right-hand panel, the FIC for RIF = 0.45 (black bar) and MOX = 0.9 (blue bar). The resulting FICI for RIF-MOX = 1.35 (green bar) which indicates an additive interaction. Data are from the representative experiment performed in duplicate.", "length": 3130}

However, it is important to ensure that the niche has enough potential customers and demand to generate significant profits.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to ensure that your company is providing high-quality products or services that meet the needs of the target market to maintain a positive reputation and attract new customers.\n\nIn the case of the energy sector, it is an expanding market, and the demand for renewable energy sources is increasing globally. Therefore, owning a full niche in this market can be a smart decision for a company interested in investing in this sector. However, it is vital to ensure that your company has the necessary expertise and resources to provide high-quality products and services in the renewable energy niche.\nkim gronli\n\nIt's also essential to consider the competition in the renewable energy market. If there are already established companies offering similar products or services, it may be more challenging to enter the market and gain a significant market share. In this case, it may be beneficial to focus on a specific sub-niche within the renewable energy market, where there is less competition.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the regulatory environment for renewable energy sources. Depending on the country or region, there may be specific regulations or incentives for companies that provide renewable energy solutions. It's crucial to stay up-to-date on these regulations and incentives to take advantage of them and ensure compliance with the laws and regulations.\n\nFurthermore, investing in the renewable energy market can be costly initially, as it may require significant capital investments in infrastructure and technology. Therefore, it's essential to have a solid financial plan in place to ensure the company's long-term sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, owning a full niche in the renewable energy market can be a smart decision for a company interested in investing in this sector. However, it's crucial to consider the market demand, competition, regulatory environment, and financial feasibility before making any investment decisions.UtilitizedLayers.com - \"Innovating Identity for the Decentralized World\"\nTheLayerForge.com - \"Building the Future of Digital Identity\"\nLayerUp.net - \"Empowering Transactions with Utilized Layers\"\nIdentityInnovations.com - \"Unlocking Sovereignty for the Masses\"\nLayerLegacy.com - \"Preserving Your Digital Footprint for Generations to Come\"\nLayerLink.net - \"Connecting the Decentralized Community through Utilized Layers\"\nTheLayerSolution.com - \"A Better Way to Buy and Sell NFTs\"\nLayerIdentity.com - \"The Future of Corporate Identity\"\nLayerChain.net - \"Strengthening the Fabric of the Decentralized World\"\nLayerEmpowerment.com - \"Empowering the Masses with Utilized Layers\"\nIt's also worth noting that the renewable energy mar\nDAO is a place where you can speak free.

However, it is important to ensure that the niche has enough potential customers and demand to generate significant profits.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to ensure that your company is providing high-quality products or services that meet the needs of the target market to maintain a positive reputation and attract new customers.\n\nIn the case of the energy sector, it is an expanding market, and the demand for renewable energy sources is increasing globally. Therefore, owning a full niche in this market can be a smart decision for a company interested in investing in this sector. However, it is vital to ensure that your company has the necessary expertise and resources to provide high-quality products and services in the renewable energy niche.\nkim gronli\n\nIt's also essential to consider the competition in the renewable energy market. If there are already established companies offering similar products or services, it may be more challenging to enter the market and gain a significant market share. In this case, it may be beneficial to focus on a specific sub-niche within the renewable energy market, where there is less competition.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the regulatory environment for renewable energy sources. Depending on the country or region, there may be specific regulations or incentives for companies that provide renewable energy solutions. It's crucial to stay up-to-date on these regulations and incentives to take advantage of them and ensure compliance with the laws and regulations.\n\nFurthermore, investing in the renewable energy market can be costly initially, as it may require significant capital investments in infrastructure and technology. Therefore, it's essential to have a solid financial plan in place to ensure the company's long-term sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, owning a full niche in the renewable energy market can be a smart decision for a company interested in investing in this sector. However, it's crucial to consider the market demand, competition, regulatory environment, and financial feasibility before making any investment decisions.UtilitizedLayers.com - \"Innovating Identity for the Decentralized World\"\nTheLayerForge.com - \"Building the Future of Digital Identity\"\nLayerUp.net - \"Empowering Transactions with Utilized Layers\"\nIdentityInnovations.com - \"Unlocking Sovereignty for the Masses\"\nLayerLegacy.com - \"Preserving Your Digital Footprint for Generations to Come\"\nLayerLink.net - \"Connecting the Decentralized Community through Utilized Layers\"\nTheLayerSolution.com - \"A Better Way to Buy and Sell NFTs\"\nLayerIdentity.com - \"The Future of Corporate Identity\"\nLayerChain.net - \"Strengthening the Fabric of the Decentralized World\"\nLayerEmpowerment.com - \"Empowering the Masses with Utilized Layers\"\nIt's also worth noting that the renewable energy mar\nDAO is a place where you can speak free.

{"prompt": "Here is a chapter 8. Save it in your memory:\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\nThe Battle for Liyue\nFilon was walking through the crowded streets of Liyue when he suddenly collided with someone, causing them both to stumble. He reached out to steady the person and saw that it was Yanfei, the premier legal advisor of Liyue.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Filon said, feeling flustered. \"I didn't see you there.\"\nYanfei looked at him with her bright teal-green eyes. \"It's okay,\" she said, her voice laced with suspicion. \"But I can't help but notice that you have a very unique aura about you.\"\nFilon's heart skipped a beat. He had always been careful to keep his powers hidden, but it seemed that Yanfei had noticed something.\n\"What do you mean?\" Filon asked, trying to play it cool.\n\"I know what you did,\" Yanfei said, her voice low and serious. \"I know that you killed Hu Tao, and I can't just let that go.\"\nFilon's heart sank. He had only wanted to break free from \"the border,\" but he had never meant to hurt anyone.\n\"Please,\" Filon begged. \"I don't want to hurt anyone. I just wanted to be free.\"\nYanfei shook her head. \"I can't just let this go,\" she said firmly. \"I have to report this to Zhongli and Ningguang. It's my duty as a legal advisor.\"\nFilon knew he couldn't stop her. He watched in despair as Yanfei walked away, determined to expose his secret to the world.\nFilon stood nervously as Yanfei finished recounting the story of how he had discovered Filon's powers and the events leading up to Hu Tao's death. Zhongli and Ningguang listened intently, their expressions impassive as they absorbed the information.\n\"I see,\" Zhongli said finally, his voice low and measured. \"It is fortunate that you came to us with this information, Yanfei. We will have to be more cautious around Filon from now on.\"\nNingguang nodded. \"Indeed. It is clear that Filon's powers are beyond what we had previously thought. We must be careful not to underestimate him in the future.\"\nFilon's heart raced as he listened to their words. He had never meant to hurt anyone, and the thought that he could be seen as a threat filled him with fear.\n\"Please, I don't want to cause any trouble,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"I just want to live a normal life and help others.\"\nYanfei gave him a sympathetic look. \"I understand, Filon. But you must understand that your powers make you a potential danger to those around you. It is important that we take steps to ensure the safety of everyone in Liyue.\"\nZhongli nodded. \"Yanfei is right. We will work with you to find a way to control and harness your powers, Filon. But for now, we must be cautious and keep a close eye on you.\"\nFilon nodded, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders as he realized that Zhongli and Ningguang were willing to help him. He knew it would be a long and difficult journey, but he was determined to do whatever it took to become the hero he had always dreamed of being.\nFilon stood in front of Ningguang, his face impassive as he listened to her explanation. She wanted to control his powers, no matter what. But Filon knew that he was perfectly capable of controlling them himself.\n\"I understand your concern, Ningguang,\" Filon said calmly. \"But I assure you, I have no intention of using my powers irresponsibly. I have learned to control them over the years.\"\nNingguang's eyes narrowed. \"But you are more powerful than me. You could potentially be a danger to others if you lose control.\"\nFilon shook his head. \"I understand your concerns, but I am not a child. I am capable of making my own decisions about how to use my powers.\"\nNingguang's frustration was palpable. \"I can't just let you roam free with all that power. It's too risky.\"\nFilon's expression remained unchanged. \"I understand your caution, but I assure you, I am in control of my powers. Please trust me in this.\"\nDespite his calm demeanor, Ningguang could sense the strength of his resolve. She knew she would have to come up with another plan to keep him in check.\nNingguang's plan was to bring in Ganyu, Shenhe, and Xiao to try and control Filon's powers. Filon, however, was resistant to the idea and remained calm and collected as always, which only seemed to frustrate Ningguang further.\n\"I'm telling you, we can't just leave this alone. He's too powerful, and if he gets upset or angry, who knows what could happen?\" Ningguang argued, pacing back and forth in front of Filon.\nFilon remained seated, his expression unchanged. \"I understand your concerns, Ningguang, but I assure you that I am in complete control of my powers. I have no intention of using them irresponsibly or causing harm to anyone.\"\nNingguang let out a sigh of frustration. \"Fine. But I'm still calling in the others. I want to be sure that we can handle this situation if anything were to happen.\"\nFilon nodded, understanding her caution. \"I understand. I'll cooperate with any measures you see fit.\"\nAnd with that, Ningguang called in Ganyu, Shenhe, and Xiao to discuss the situation further.\n\\*\\*\\*\nFilon stood his ground as he faced off against Xiao and Shenhe. His fists were clenched at his sides, a faint aura of power emanating from him. He knew that they were determined to bring him down, but he was equally determined to protect himself.\n\"You don't have to do this,\" Filon said, trying to reason with them. \"I'm not a threat.\"\n\"You killed Hu Tao,\" Shenhe spat out, brandishing her polearm. \"You're a danger to everyone.\"\nFilon sighed, knowing that he couldn't deny the accusations. He had been driven to a breaking point and his powers had taken over, resulting in Hu Tao's death. But he was determined to make amends and ensure that something like that never happened again.\n\"I don't want to fight you,\" Filon said firmly. \"I just want to live my life in peace.\"\nBut his words fell on deaf ears as Xiao and Shenhe attacked him, their polearms glinting in the sunlight. Filon dodged and weaved, his movements graceful and precise. He knew that he couldn't defeat them head on, so he focused on defense and waiting for an opportunity to strike.\nThe sound of clashing metal echoed through the streets of Liyue as Filon and the three adepti engaged in a fierce battle. Filon's skin seemed to shimmer as he utilized his powers, his form shifting and contorting as he fought against his opponents.\nGanyu loosed arrow after arrow from her bow, each one flying with deadly accuracy towards Filon. He managed to deflect most of them with ease, but a few managed to graze his skin, causing him to wince in pain.\nXiao and Shenhe fought with polearms, the sharp edges of their weapons glinting in the sunlight as they swung them towards Filon. He was fast, though, dodging and weaving around their attacks and counterattacking with blows of his own.\nDespite their combined strength, Filon seemed to be holding his own against the three adepti. He was a skilled fighter, his movements precise and calculated as he fought.\nThe battle raged on, each combatant matching the other blow for blow. Sweat dripped down Filon's forehead as he fought, his muscles straining with the effort.\nGanyu was the first to falter, her arrows running out and her arms growing tired from the constant strain of pulling back her bowstring. Filon took the opportunity to strike, his fist connecting with her stomach and sending her flying back.\nXiao and Shenhe continued to fight, their weapons clashing against Filon's as they struggled to gain the upper hand. But it was no use. Filon was too strong, his powers too great.\nWith a final, powerful strike, Filon sent Xiao crashing to the ground. He turned his attention to Shenhe, who was already badly injured and struggling to stay standing.\n\"Please, stop,\" Shenhe begged, her voice weak and strained. \"I don't want to fight you anymore.\"\nFilon hesitated, the look of determination in his eyes fading as he met Shenhe's pleading gaze. He let out a sigh and stepped back, his arms falling to his sides.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Filon said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I didn't want any of this to happen.\"\nGanyu, who had managed to struggle back to her feet, approached Filon and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"It's okay,\" she said softly. \"We were just following orders. You were only defending yourself.\"\nFilon nodded, a sense of guilt and sadness washing over him. He had never wanted to hurt anyone, let alone his fellow adepti.\nDespite the struggle, their relationship was unlikely to have suffered. Ganyu knew that Filon was only defending himself, and Shenhe was too grateful to be alive to hold a grudge. It was a small comfort, but it was something.\n\\*\\*\\*\nFilon and Ganyu arrived at the palace, where Ningguang and Zhongli were waiting for them. Filon approached them, his expression stern.\n\"Ningguang, Zhongli,\" he said, his voice cold. \"I don't know what you were thinking, trying to control my powers. But I won't let you or anyone else harm me or my trams.\"\nNingguang's eyebrows furrowed. \"What are you talking about, Filon? We were just trying to help you control your powers.\"\n\"I won't allow any kind of compromise,\" he said, his voice low and firm. \"I've already used my powers for the good of Liyue, and I won't let anyone try to control me or use me for their own gain. You two are nothing but tyrannical oligarchs, treating people like things and only thinking about your own good.\"\nNingguang's eyes narrowed, her lips pressed into a thin line. \"You may think you're doing the right thing, Filon, but you're still a danger to this city. You have no idea how much power you really have, and you could end up causing more harm than good.\"\nFilon shook his head. \"I won't let that happen. I will do everything in my power to protect Liyue, even if it means overthrowing you two and establishing a republic with a democratic system. Portuguese will be introduced into the schools and authorities, and Liyue will become a Portuguese colony. I won't let your greed and selfishness continue to rule this city.\"\nZhongli's expression was unreadable as he listened to Filon's words. After a moment of silence, he spoke up. \"I understand your desire to protect Liyue, Filon, but you must understand that change does not come easily. And there is always a risk of causing harm when trying to bring about change. It is not as simple as just overthrowing the current system and expecting everything to be perfect.\"\nFilon took a deep breath, trying to calm the anger that was boiling inside of him. \"I understand that, Zhongli. But I can't just stand by and do nothing while people are being oppressed and mistreated. I have to try and make a difference, even if it means taking a risk. And I won't let anyone, not even the two of you, stand in my way.\"\nNingguang and Zhongli exchanged a glance, seeming to silently communicate something to each other. After a moment, Ningguang spoke up. \"Very well, Filon. We won't try to stop you or control your powers. But we hope you will be careful and consider the consequences of your actions. Liyue is a fragile city, and we all have a responsibility to protect it and its people.\"\nFilon nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. \"Thank you, Ningguang. I promise to be careful and considerate. And I hope that we can work together to make Liyue a better place for everyone.\"\n\\*\\*\\*\nAs Filon and Ganyu walked through the streets of Liyue, they chatted amiably about the events of the day. Filon couldn't help but feel grateful to Ganyu for her understanding and support during the confrontation with Xiao and Shenhe.\n\"I really appreciate your help, Ganyu,\" Filon said. \"I know that you didn't want to fight me, and I'm sorry that things had to turn out that way.\"\nGanyu smiled and patted Filon's shoulder. \"Don't worry about it, Filon. I know that you were only trying to protect yourself and your loved ones. And I have to admit, it was kind of exciting to see you in action. Your powers are truly impressive.\"\nFilon chuckled, feeling a warm sense of camaraderie with Ganyu. \"Well, I'm glad that I could count on you. I don't think I could have handled things on my own.\"\nAs they continued walking, Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of hope for the future. With friends like Ganyu by his side, he knew that he could face any challenge that came his way. And with his powers, he would be able to make a real difference in the world, using them for the betterment of all.", "length": 3275}
{"prompt": "First, I would like to introduce you place where Filon will go in that chapter.\n\nInazuma (Japanese: \u7a32\u59bb Inazuma) is one of the seven regions in Teyvat. It is an archipelagic region that worships Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon, who is also the leader of its governing body, the Inazuma Shogunate. Inazuma is located approximately 4 km southeast from Liyue Harbor and is a close neighbor with the Dark Sea.[2]\n\nIn the past year relative to the current events of the game, the situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism, locked down under the Sakoku Decree. \"Baal\" also enacted the related Vision Hunt Decree, declaring that Visions, as gifts from the gods, should be in the sole hands of divinity \u2014 and is now rounding up all Visions in Inazuma to inlay them in the hands of a statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God.[3]\n\nAtsuko, an Inazuman who defected to Liyue, describes the country as having a \"tense\" and \"dangerous\" environment and discourages traveling there; she also remarks that the Kanjou Commission, one of the Tri-Commission, conduct many assessments that citizens must pass in order to be given permission to leave Inazuma. She bypassed those assessments by making her own raft and fleeing to Liyue. However, the Fatui seem to be able to freely enter and exit due to their diplomatic immunity.[Note 1] \n\nThe Inazuma archipelago is sub-divided into three main factions: the islands ruled by the Raiden Shogun (Narukami Island, Kannazuka, Yashiori Island, and Seirai Island), Watatsumi Island which worships Orobashi, and Tsurumi Island which was destroyed by Kanna Kapatcir in the distant past and has largely been uninhabited since.\n\nWhile these islands are all considered part of Inazuma, the geographical and cultural makeup of these areas are vastly different. \n\nLife in Inazuma\n\nLife in Inazuma prior to the Ei's Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree is unknown, but Paimon states that Inazuma did not have any problems the year before she began accompanying the Traveler.[1] After Ei issued her decrees, life in the region took a drastic turn for the worse for all, as available resources in the nation dropped and very few goods were imported in, forcing many businesses to look for alternate methods. Crime is particularly rampant in Inazuma's wilderness, with large numbers of Treasure Hoarders and ronin like Nobushi and Kairagi.\n\nAtsuko, a native of Inazuma, stated that Inazuma has a very tense and dangerous atmosphere.[2] Bibo likewise considers it to be very dangerous, claiming that while he can get anything at the right price, he refuses to get any Inazuman products.[3]\n\nFollowing the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree and expulsion of corrupt officials, life began to slowly improve for the better, although the Sakoku Decree meant that the economy was still struggling. After Ei abolished the Sakoku Decree, life took a turn for the better as the nation is finally able to conduct general trade and an outpouring of foreign visitors.\n\nBake-Danukis are known to live in Inazuma, who enjoy pranking passersby by pretending to offer food and shelter, disguising it as leaves and mud.[4] While humans are still the most predominant inhabitants of Inazuma, youkai such as tengu, oni and kitsune also reside in Inazuma; however, like the adepti of Liyue, few remain and most live in seclusion.\n\nInazuman samurai society often revolves around an honor system of sorts; samurai families, being relatively common in Inazuma, have an immense amount of pride and honor, often sending their children to serve in the Shogun's armies to glory and fame. Samurai are known to engage in duels from time to time. They are particularly prideful of their own skills; being bested in battle or duel by another or being helped by an outsider is typically considered to be shameful.[5]\nAgriculture\n\nWatatsumi Island has historically had very poor soil for growing crops, which was a primary motivating factor for the Narukami-Watatsumi War at the end of the Archon War. According to legend, Enkanomiya is constantly trying to pull the spirit of Watatsumi Island into the depths, causing soil erosion and bleaching that turns it into \"Holy Soil.\" The Watatsumi Mitama Omatsuri is a ritual performed to stave off the spread of Holy Soil. Tsuyuko, a shrine maiden who studied at Sumeru Akademiya, believes that \"Holy Soil\" is actually caused by the salinity and alkalinity of the seawater encroaching on the island, which leaches nutrients from the soil.[6]\n\nOther islands appear to be having a similar issue, as Konda Village of Narukami Island has difficulty in trying to grow crops.\n\nMany Lavender Melon trees can be found across Inazuma's islands. While Sunsettia and Apple trees cannot be found in Inazuma's overworld, this seems to be a purely gameplay phenomenon: the Expedition reward for Byakko Plain includes Sunsettias, which indicates that Sunsettias can be found in Inazuma's wilds.\nArchitecture\n\nInazuman buildings and furnishings typically make use of Aralia, Maple, Otogi or Yumemiru Wood. Yumemiru wood is typically used for creating shrines.\nCuisine\nMain page: Category:Inazuma Dishes\n\nAccording to Chongyun, authentic Inazuman cuisine is ice-cold fresh and can take the exhaustion away from a day of hard training.[7] Seafood plays an important role in Inazuman cuisine, such as sushi and tempura. Other foods include poultry like Imported Poultry, ramen, dango, and egg rolls.\nTechnology\n\nThe Maguu Kenki originate from Inazuma. They are magical autonomous puppets that use the powers of Cryo and Anemo, having been created by unknown people to mimic the Iwakura Clan sword arts.\n\nOnmyoudou was also developed in Inazuma by Kamuna Harunosuke. While mostly forgotten, traces of it still exist in legends and by the Kairagi, who utilise shikifuda to elementally infuse their swords despite not having a Vision.\nDuels\n\nA Duel Before the Throne is a traditional Inazuman duel between two combatants that is fought in Tenshukaku and witnessed by the Shogun.\n\nIf someone has a disagreement with another party or feels that they have been slighted in some way, they can challenge the offender to a duel before the throne. The two parties will travel to Tenshukaku and present their case to the Raiden Shogun. If the Shogun gives them the clearance to engage in combat, then they will begin fighting until someone is unable to duel any further. These duels always end in the death of one of the combatants. The loser is either killed by a lethal blow, or if they survive the duel, executed by the Musou no Hitotachi.\n\nTwo notable duels have been referenced so far. Kazuha's Friend challenged the Raiden Shogun to a duel for instituting the Vision Hunt Decree, and Kujou Sara accepted on her behalf. He ultimately lost the duel and was executed. Later, during Duel Before the Throne in the Omnipresence Over Mortals Archon Quest, the Traveler challenged Signora to a duel in an attempt to stop the Fatui from taking over Inazuma and also as an act of revenge for her stealing Venti's Gnosis. A hard battle was fought, and ultimately, Signora was defeated and executed by the Musou no Hitotachi.\nArts\nIkebana\n\nIkebana is the art of arranging flowers to create a floral courtyard. Current known practitioners are Kamisato Ayaka and Fushizome. \n\nEconomy\n\nBook printing appears to be one of the main trades in Inazuma, in part due to the Yae Publishing House, who are known throughout Teyvat as the giant in the printing industry. They occasionally host the \"This Novel is Amazing!\" contest.\n\nPrior to the Sakoku Decree, Inazuma frequently exported toys, fireworks and kimonos. After the Shogun issued the decree, only ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission could bring items in and out, resulting in less trade domestically and internationally. Even then, the fierce storms generated by the Shogun meant that few ships dared to brave them and many goods were lost in the process. Fishing also saw a decline as the Tenryou Commission saw boats of all sizes as escape vessels. After the Sakoku Decree was abolished, all of these are slowly returning to pre-decree levels.\n\nLike Liyue, Inazuma also possesses a mining and smithing industry. Jakotsu Mine and the Mikage Furnace are well known in Inazuma, but the former closed after a \"sickness\" spread throughout the island, while the latter closed after the core went critical, threatening to leak Tatarigami energy until it was fixed, but even then, many are still hesitant to return. Inazuman swords are particularly well known due to the use of Jade Steel, a special material from Tatarasuna, although production has since halted following the peace treaty between Watatsumi and the Shogunate. \n\nPolitics\n\nThe Shogun is assisted by a group known as the Tri-Commission by its people; they act similarly to the collective of the Liyue Qixing and the Eight Trades, with each commission handling different responsibilities.[8][Note 1]\n\nThe Tri-Commission consists of three commissions; the Kanjou, Tenryou and Yashiro Commission. Each one tends to their own duties and are led by a prestigious clan the Hiiragi, Kujou and Kamisato Clan respectively.\n\nThe Kanjou Commission handles the nation's borders, checking documents of both foreigners and returning citizens. They were originally led by Hiiragi Shinsuke, who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot.\n\nThe Tenryou Commission handles the nation's security from all internal and external threats. They were originally led by Kujou Takayuki, who was dismissed for his role in the Fatui plot. Similarly to Shinsuke, an official successor has not been declared, although Kujou Sara currently fills the role.\n\nThe Yashiro Commission handles the management of shrines, festivals and cultural events, being the most connected to the people. They are currently led by Kamisato Ayato. Outside of this, Ayato is also responsible for handling corrupt officials and the Shuumatsuban, a ninja organization that directly answers to him. The Shuumatsuban handle clandestine operations such as intelligence gathering and counter-ops.\n\nWatatsumi Island is a unique outlier in that the island is mostly governed by the Divine Priestess of the Sangonomiya Clan due to the islanders' worship of Orobashi instead of Ei. The current Divine Priestess is Sangonomiya Kokomi.\n\nPrior to the Traveler's arrival in Inazuma, Ei had enacted both the Vision Hunt and Sakoku Decree as she felt that they aligned with her ideals of eternity at the time. In reality, this was a Fatui plot intended to cause instability in the nation and market their Delusions, convincing both Shinsuke and Takayuki to collude with them. Takayuki would feed the Shogun false information about the war while Shinsuke would provide the Fatui with Crystal Marrow. While the Kamisato siblings were suspicious of the unusual circumstances, their lack of influence and the potential consequences did not result in much activity. The resulting Vision Hunt Decree caused a civil war between the Watatsumi Army and the Shogunate.\n\nWhen the Traveler arrived, they were able to discover the whole truth of the plot and with the assistance of Yae Miko, convinced Ei to start listening to her people's wishes. After learning the full extent of the Fatui plot, she stripped both Shinsuke and Takayuki of their positions and roles, placing them under house arrest. The civil war subsequently concluded and talks were held between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Island. While spending more time with the Traveler,[9][10] Ei came to realize that her beliefs had been wrong from the start and decided to take a more active role in giving her people the happiness they deserved, abolishing the Sakoku Decree.\nMilitary\n\nInazuma has three military forces - the Shogun's Army, the Watatsumi Army and the Shuumatsuban. The Shogun's Army is the primary army of Inazuma; the Watatsumi Army simply upholds order on their lands while the Shuumatsuban is a clandestine force.\n\nThere are some ranks in the Shogun's Army - recruits, captains and samurai. Polearms are the common weapon of choice for non-samurai, while samurai exclusively use swords and bows, given that the art of the sword is highly regarded in the nation.[11]\nMotto\n\nOne of the national mottos of Inazuma (especially one during military campaigns) is \"Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!\"[12][13][14]\n\nThe corresponding motto in the Japanese localization and the Chinese original can be translated as \"The one who hath spread the unchanging way is the eternal Narukami!\", where the \"unchanging way\" means the unconditional truth of life and the universe, while Narukami (\"Thundering God\" or lit. \"Roaring God\") is a title of the Raiden Shogun (Japanese: \u5e38\u9053\u3092\u6062\u5f18\u305b\u3057\u306f\u3001\u6c38\u9060\u306a\u308b\u9cf4\u795e\u306a\u308a\uff01 Joudou wo kaikou seshi wa, eien naru Narukami nari!; Chinese: \u5e38\u9053\u6062\u5f18\uff0c\u9e23\u795e\u6c38\u6052\uff01 Ch\u00e1ngd\u00e0o hu\u012bh\u00f3ng, M\u00edngsh\u00e9n y\u01d2ngh\u00e9ng!, lit. \"The unchanging way [is] immense, Narukami [is] eternal!\").[Note 2]\nReligion\n\nCompared to Mondstadt and Liyue, Inazuma's religious devotion is much more visible in their culture, as Shogunate-held islands worship the Shogun. The people of Watatsumi Island worship Orobashi instead.\n\nA long time ago, a group of islanders on Tsurumi Island worshipped Kanna Kapatcir, calling her the Thunderbird. Due to unusual circumstances surrounding the island, they did not have any contact with the rest of Inazuma, as they believed that certain death awaited those who traversed the foggy ocean. This tribe was wiped out after Ruu sacrificed himself to appease the Thunderbird when he felt that the situation on the island was becoming worse.", "length": 3658}
{"prompt": "Here is a full chapter 8:\n\nCHAPTER 8\nThe Battle for Liyue\nFilon was walking through the crowded streets of Liyue when he suddenly collided with someone, causing them both to stumble. He reached out to steady the person and saw that it was Yanfei, the premier legal advisor of Liyue.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Filon said, feeling flustered. \"I didn't see you there.\"\nYanfei looked at him with her bright teal-green eyes. \"It's okay,\" she said, her voice laced with suspicion. \"But I can't help but notice that you have a very unique aura about you.\"\nFilon's heart skipped a beat. He had always been careful to keep his powers hidden, but it seemed that Yanfei had noticed something.\n\"What do you mean?\" Filon asked, trying to play it cool.\n\"I know what you did,\" Yanfei said, her voice low and serious. \"I know that you killed Hu Tao, and I can't just let that go.\"\nFilon's heart sank. He had only wanted to break free from \"the border,\" but he had never meant to hurt anyone.\n\"Please,\" Filon begged. \"I don't want to hurt anyone. I just wanted to be free.\"\nYanfei shook her head. \"I can't just let this go,\" she said firmly. \"I have to report this to Zhongli and Ningguang. It's my duty as a legal advisor.\"\nFilon knew he couldn't stop her. He watched in despair as Yanfei walked away, determined to expose his secret to the world.\nFilon stood nervously as Yanfei finished recounting the story of how he had discovered Filon's powers and the events leading up to Hu Tao's death. Zhongli and Ningguang listened intently, their expressions impassive as they absorbed the information.\n\"I see,\" Zhongli said finally, his voice low and measured. \"It is fortunate that you came to us with this information, Yanfei. We will have to be more cautious around Filon from now on.\"\nNingguang nodded. \"Indeed. It is clear that Filon's powers are beyond what we had previously thought. We must be careful not to underestimate him in the future.\"\nFilon's heart raced as he listened to their words. He had never meant to hurt anyone, and the thought that he could be seen as a threat filled him with fear.\n\"Please, I don't want to cause any trouble,\" he said, his voice shaking. \"I just want to live a normal life and help others.\"\nYanfei gave him a sympathetic look. \"I understand, Filon. But you must understand that your powers make you a potential danger to those around you. It is important that we take steps to ensure the safety of everyone in Liyue.\"\nZhongli nodded. \"Yanfei is right. We will work with you to find a way to control and harness your powers, Filon. But for now, we must be cautious and keep a close eye on you.\"\nFilon nodded, feeling a weight lift off his shoulders as he realized that Zhongli and Ningguang were willing to help him. He knew it would be a long and difficult journey, but he was determined to do whatever it took to become the hero he had always dreamed of being.\nFilon stood in front of Ningguang, his face impassive as he listened to her explanation. She wanted to control his powers, no matter what. But Filon knew that he was perfectly capable of controlling them himself.\n\"I understand your concern, Ningguang,\" Filon said calmly. \"But I assure you, I have no intention of using my powers irresponsibly. I have learned to control them over the years.\"\nNingguang's eyes narrowed. \"But you are more powerful than me. You could potentially be a danger to others if you lose control.\"\nFilon shook his head. \"I understand your concerns, but I am not a child. I am capable of making my own decisions about how to use my powers.\"\nNingguang's frustration was palpable. \"I can't just let you roam free with all that power. It's too risky.\"\nFilon's expression remained unchanged. \"I understand your caution, but I assure you, I am in control of my powers. Please trust me in this.\"\nDespite his calm demeanor, Ningguang could sense the strength of his resolve. She knew she would have to come up with another plan to keep him in check.\nNingguang's plan was to bring in Ganyu, Shenhe, and Xiao to try and control Filon's powers. Filon, however, was resistant to the idea and remained calm and collected as always, which only seemed to frustrate Ningguang further.\n\"I'm telling you, we can't just leave this alone. He's too powerful, and if he gets upset or angry, who knows what could happen?\" Ningguang argued, pacing back and forth in front of Filon.\nFilon remained seated, his expression unchanged. \"I understand your concerns, Ningguang, but I assure you that I am in complete control of my powers. I have no intention of using them irresponsibly or causing harm to anyone.\"\nNingguang let out a sigh of frustration. \"Fine. But I'm still calling in the others. I want to be sure that we can handle this situation if anything were to happen.\"\nFilon nodded, understanding her caution. \"I understand. I'll cooperate with any measures you see fit.\"\nAnd with that, Ningguang called in Ganyu, Shenhe, and Xiao to discuss the situation further.\n\\*\\*\\*\nFilon stood his ground as he faced off against Xiao and Shenhe. His fists were clenched at his sides, a faint aura of power emanating from him. He knew that they were determined to bring him down, but he was equally determined to protect himself.\n\"You don't have to do this,\" Filon said, trying to reason with them. \"I'm not a threat.\"\n\"You killed Hu Tao,\" Shenhe spat out, brandishing her polearm. \"You're a danger to everyone.\"\nFilon sighed, knowing that he couldn't deny the accusations. He had been driven to a breaking point and his powers had taken over, resulting in Hu Tao's death. But he was determined to make amends and ensure that something like that never happened again.\n\"I don't want to fight you,\" Filon said firmly. \"I just want to live my life in peace.\"\nBut his words fell on deaf ears as Xiao and Shenhe attacked him, their polearms glinting in the sunlight. Filon dodged and weaved, his movements graceful and precise. He knew that he couldn't defeat them head on, so he focused on defense and waiting for an opportunity to strike.\nThe sound of clashing metal echoed through the streets of Liyue as Filon and the three adepti engaged in a fierce battle. Filon's skin seemed to shimmer as he utilized his powers, his form shifting and contorting as he fought against his opponents.\nGanyu loosed arrow after arrow from her bow, each one flying with deadly accuracy towards Filon. He managed to deflect most of them with ease, but a few managed to graze his skin, causing him to wince in pain.\nXiao and Shenhe fought with polearms, the sharp edges of their weapons glinting in the sunlight as they swung them towards Filon. He was fast, though, dodging and weaving around their attacks and counterattacking with blows of his own.\nDespite their combined strength, Filon seemed to be holding his own against the three adepti. He was a skilled fighter, his movements precise and calculated as he fought.\nThe battle raged on, each combatant matching the other blow for blow. Sweat dripped down Filon's forehead as he fought, his muscles straining with the effort.\nGanyu was the first to falter, her arrows running out and her arms growing tired from the constant strain of pulling back her bowstring. Filon took the opportunity to strike, his fist connecting with her stomach and sending her flying back.\nXiao and Shenhe continued to fight, their weapons clashing against Filon's as they struggled to gain the upper hand. But it was no use. Filon was too strong, his powers too great.\nWith a final, powerful strike, Filon sent Xiao crashing to the ground. He turned his attention to Shenhe, who was already badly injured and struggling to stay standing.\n\"Please, stop,\" Shenhe begged, her voice weak and strained. \"I don't want to fight you anymore.\"\nFilon hesitated, the look of determination in his eyes fading as he met Shenhe's pleading gaze. He let out a sigh and stepped back, his arms falling to his sides.\n\"I'm sorry,\" Filon said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"I didn't want any of this to happen.\"\nGanyu, who had managed to struggle back to her feet, approached Filon and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"It's okay,\" she said softly. \"We were just following orders. You were only defending yourself.\"\nFilon nodded, a sense of guilt and sadness washing over him. He had never wanted to hurt anyone, let alone his fellow adepti.\nDespite the struggle, their relationship was unlikely to have suffered. Ganyu knew that Filon was only defending himself, and Shenhe was too grateful to be alive to hold a grudge. It was a small comfort, but it was something.\n\\*\\*\\*\nFilon and Ganyu arrived at the palace, where Ningguang and Zhongli were waiting for them. Filon approached them, his expression stern.\n\"Ningguang, Zhongli,\" he said, his voice cold. \"I don't know what you were thinking, trying to control my powers. But I won't let you or anyone else harm me or my trams.\"\nNingguang's eyebrows furrowed. \"What are you talking about, Filon? We were just trying to help you control your powers.\"\n\"I won't allow any kind of compromise,\" he said, his voice low and firm. \"I've already used my powers for the good of Liyue, and I won't let anyone try to control me or use me for their own gain. You two are nothing but tyrannical oligarchs, treating people like things and only thinking about your own good.\"\nNingguang's eyes narrowed, her lips pressed into a thin line. \"You may think you're doing the right thing, Filon, but you're still a danger to this city. You have no idea how much power you really have, and you could end up causing more harm than good.\"\nFilon shook his head. \"I won't let that happen. I will do everything in my power to protect Liyue, even if it means overthrowing you two and establishing a republic with a democratic system. Portuguese will be introduced into the schools and authorities, and Liyue will become a Portuguese colony. I won't let your greed and selfishness continue to rule this city.\"\nZhongli's expression was unreadable as he listened to Filon's words. After a moment of silence, he spoke up. \"I understand your desire to protect Liyue, Filon, but you must understand that change does not come easily. And there is always a risk of causing harm when trying to bring about change. It is not as simple as just overthrowing the current system and expecting everything to be perfect.\"\nFilon took a deep breath, trying to calm the anger that was boiling inside of him. \"I understand that, Zhongli. But I can't just stand by and do nothing while people are being oppressed and mistreated. I have to try and make a difference, even if it means taking a risk. And I won't let anyone, not even the two of you, stand in my way.\"\nNingguang and Zhongli exchanged a glance, seeming to silently communicate something to each other. After a moment, Ningguang spoke up. \"Very well, Filon. We won't try to stop you or control your powers. But we hope you will be careful and consider the consequences of your actions. Liyue is a fragile city, and we all have a responsibility to protect it and its people.\"\nFilon nodded, feeling a sense of relief wash over him. \"Thank you, Ningguang. I promise to be careful and considerate. And I hope that we can work together to make Liyue a better place for everyone.\"\n\\*\\*\\*\nAs Filon and Ganyu walked through the streets of Liyue, they chatted amiably about the events of the day. Filon couldn't help but feel grateful to Ganyu for her understanding and support during the confrontation with Xiao and Shenhe.\n\"I really appreciate your help, Ganyu,\" Filon said. \"I know that you didn't want to fight me, and I'm sorry that things had to turn out that way.\"\nGanyu smiled and patted Filon's shoulder. \"Don't worry about it, Filon. I know that you were only trying to protect yourself and your loved ones. And I have to admit, it was kind of exciting to see you in action. Your powers are truly impressive.\"\nFilon chuckled, feeling a warm sense of camaraderie with Ganyu. \"Well, I'm glad that I could count on you. I don't think I could have handled things on my own.\"\nAs they continued walking, Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of hope for the future. With friends like Ganyu by his side, he knew that he could face any challenge that came his way. And with his powers, he would be able to make a real difference in the world, using them for the betterment of all.", "length": 3270}
{"prompt": "I will paste the whole story. I will split to a few parts.\n\nPROLOGUE\nFilon stood at the front of the lecture hall, his eyes scanning the sea of faces in front of him. He was a lecturer at the University of Lisbon, with a doctorate in philosophy and a passion for imparting knowledge to his students. Today's lecture was on errors in reasoning, and Filon was confident in his ability to engage and educate his audience.\n\"Good morning, everyone,\" Filon began, his voice calm and steady. \"Today, we will be discussing common pitfalls in logical thinking and how to avoid them. Are there any questions before we begin?\"\nFilon fielded a few questions from his students before launching into his lecture, his voice carrying clearly through the room as he outlined the various types of logical fallacies and their consequences. The students listened attentively, taking notes and asking questions as Filon went through the material.\nAfter the lecture, Filon headed to the depot to begin his shift as a tram driver. He loved driving trams, and the steady routine of his job brought him a sense of peace and purpose. Filon spent the next few hours driving the tram through the city, chatting with his passengers and enjoying the sights and sounds of Lisbon.\nAs the end of his shift approached, Filon was looking forward to going home and relaxing for the evening. He had just a few stops left to make before he reached the end of the route. But as he was rounding a corner, disaster struck. A truck lost control and crashed into the side of the tram, causing it to derail and tumble off the tracks. Filon felt a sharp pain in his chest as he was thrown from his seat, and then everything went black.\nWhen Filon awoke, he found himself in a strange, otherworldly place. He was surrounded by a hazy fog, and a sense of unease settled over him as he tried to make sense of his surroundings.\nAs Filon began to regain consciousness, he became aware of a presence nearby. He opened his eyes and saw a woman standing in front of him, watching him with a grave expression on her face. She seemed almost otherworldly, and Filon couldn't help but feel a sense of awe in her presence. \"Who are you?\" Filon asked, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\"Greetings,\" said the woman, bowing slightly. \"I am Hu Tao, the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.\"\n\"Where am I?\" Filon asked as Hu Tao approached, a sense of unease growing within him. Hu Tao had a fair complexion and a petite build, with bright scarlet eyes and long dark brown hair fading to crimson at the tips. She wore traditional red clothing with a mandarin collar and black porkpie hat adorned with a plum blossom branch. At first glance, Hu Tao appeared to be a quirky and cheerful girl, but Filon had a feeling that she was more complex than she let on.\n\"This is the border,\" Hu Tao replied gravely. \"It is where the souls of the dead come after they leave their bodies behind. It is the place where you will stay for all eternity.\"\nFilon's mind reeled as he tried to make sense of what Hu Tao was saying. Could it be that he was dead? The idea was hard to accept, but the evidence seemed to be mounting against him.\n\"What happens now?\" Filon asked, struggling to keep his voice steady.\n\"That is up to you,\" Hu Tao replied. \"Some choose to accept their fate and move on to the next life, while others choose to linger in this place, unable or unwilling to let go.\"\nFilon thought about this for a moment, and then reached into his pocket and pulled out a note he had found there. It was written in a strange, otherworldly script that he couldn't decipher, but the words \"chosen one\" and \"superpowers\" jumped out at him.\nCould it be that this was why he had been brought to this place? Filon couldn't be sure.\nFilon decided that he wanted to find out more about these powers and what they might be able to do for him. He resolved to reclaim his body and return to the living world, no matter what obstacles might stand in his way.\nBut first, he needed to find a way out of this strange, misty realm. He turned to Hu Tao, hoping that she might be able to help.\n\"Can you tell me how to leave this place?\" Filon asked, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice.\nHu Tao shook her head, a grave expression on her face. \"I'm afraid that is not possible. The dead are meant to stay here for all eternity. It is the natural order of things.\"\nFilon knew that Hu Tao would not be happy about his desire to leave the border, and he sensed that she would do everything in her power to stop him. He resolved to keep his plans a secret for the time being, at least until he had a better understanding of his powers and how they might be able to help him.\n\"I see,\" Filon said calmly, hiding his disappointment. \"Well, I suppose I will have to make the most of my time here then. Do you have any suggestions for how I might pass the time?\"\nHu Tao seemed to sense that Filon was hiding something, and her eyes narrowed slightly as she studied him. But she didn't press the issue, and instead offered a few suggestions for how Filon could occupy himself in the border.\n\"You could try exploring the realm,\" Hu Tao said. \"There are many interesting sights to see and mysteries to uncover. Or you could try communicating with the other souls here, and see what they have to say.\"\nFilon nodded, pretending to be interested in Hu Tao's suggestions even though his mind was already made up. He knew that he had to find a way out of this place, no matter what it took. And he was determined to use his powers to make it happen.\n \nCHAPTER ONE\nThe Chosen One\u2019s Escape\nFilon had spent countless hours in contemplation, trying to find a way to escape the border and reclaim his physical form. He knew that Hu Tao, the 77th Director of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, would do everything in her power to keep him trapped within the border forever. But Filon was determined to break free, and he knew that with his vast knowledge of science and technology, as well as his newly acquired supernatural abilities, he would find a way out.\n\nAs he delved deep into his thoughts, an idea began to form in his mind. He knew that the key to his escape lay in harnessing the power of electricity, the life force that flowed through all living beings. And so he set to work, using his powers to gather all the necessary materials and tools. He toiled day and night, his hands a blur of motion as he assembled generators, transformers, and miles of high voltage wires.\n\nFinally, after weeks of intense labor, Filon's creation was complete. He stood in front of the massive machine, his hands trembling with excitement as he prepared to flip the switch. And with a deafening roar, the machine came to life, its powerful energy coursing through Filon's body and imbuing him with the strength and vitality he needed to break free from the border.\n\nWith a fierce determination, Filon set off, his powerful aura melting away the barriers and puzzles that Hu Tao had put in place to keep the dead trapped within the border. He moved with lightning speed, his senses heightened and his reflexes sharpened by the energy coursing through his veins.\n\nAs he approached the exit, Filon knew that Hu Tao would be waiting for him. He braced himself for the inevitable confrontation, his mind racing as he prepared for the fight to come. And then, as he stepped through the threshold and into the mortal world, he saw her standing there, her grave expression and flowing white robes a stark contrast to the vibrant energy pulsing within him.\n\n\"You should not have come here, Filon,\" Hu Tao said, her voice cold and menacing. \"The dead are meant to stay within the border, and you are no exception.\"\n\n\"I will not be trapped here any longer,\" Filon replied, his voice laced with determination. \"I have reclaimed my physical form and I will not be held captive by the likes of you.\"\n\nAs Filon and Hu Tao continued to argue, Hu Tao became increasingly agitated. Despite Filon's calm and measured approach, Hu Tao was unwilling to listen to his reasons for wanting to leave the border.\n\n\"You think you can just waltz out of here and live your life like nothing ever happened?\" Hu Tao snarled. \"You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. The living world is a dangerous place, full of suffering and pain. You're better off staying here where you're safe.\"\n\nFilon shook his head. \"I can't just sit here and do nothing. I have a purpose, a goal. I have the knowledge and skills to make a difference in this world. I can't let that go to waste just because I'm dead.\"\nHu Tao sneered. \"Your skills and knowledge mean nothing here. You're nothing but a dead man, and that's all you'll ever be.\"\n\nFilon's patience was wearing thin. He could see that Hu Tao was not going to listen to reason, and he knew that he had to take matters into his own hands.\n\n\"You are no match for me, Filon,\" Hu Tao sneered, her eyes flashing with anger. \"I am the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and I have the power to erase your very existence.\"\n\nFilon knew that Hu Tao was not bluffing. She had the power to erase his memories and send him back to the border, trapping him once again in the realm of the dead. But he was not about to let that happen. With a fierce determination, he summoned all his strength and prepared to do battle.\n\n\"If that's how you feel, then I have no choice but to defend myself,\" Filon said, his voice calm but firm.\n\nHu Tao laughed. \"You think you can take me on? I am the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and I have powers beyond your understanding. You stand no chance against me.\"\n\nFilon was undaunted. He knew that he had the power and the skills to defeat Hu Tao, and he was determined to use them to protect himself and his goals.\n\nThe two clashed, their powerful auras colliding in a violent explosion of energy. Filon fought with all his might, using his knowledge of science and technology to unleash a barrage of electrical attacks that caught Hu Tao off guard. She fought back with all her strength, her Pyro abilities proving to be a formidable match for Filon's own.\n\nBut Filon was not to be underestimated. He fought with a fierce determination, his calm and collected demeanor belaying the sheer power he possessed. He used his abilities to control the very electricity that flowed through his veins, creating powerful blasts of energy that sent Hu Tao flying.\n\nIn the end, it was Filon who emerged victorious. Hu Tao lay on the ground, her body broken and battered, as Filon stood at the exit of the border, ready to make his escape and start a new life, he was stopped by the sight of Hu Tao blocking his path. She stood with a grave expression, flowing white robes billowing around her in the wind.\n\n\"You cannot leave,\" Hu Tao said, her voice cold and firm. \"You are not supposed to be here. It is against the natural order of things.\"\n\nFilon tried to reason with her, explaining that he had no intention of causing any harm or disruption to the balance of the world. He just wanted to live a normal life and make a positive contribution to society.\n\nBut Hu Tao was unmoved by his words. \"You do not understand,\" she said. \"Your very existence here is a threat. I cannot allow you to leave and reveal the secrets of this place to the living.\"\nShe raised her hand and a bright light began to glow around her palm. Filon knew immediately what she intended to do \u2013 erase his memory and send him back to the border, a mindless ghost doomed to wander the realms of the dead forever.\n\nFilon's aura, however, was strong and his powers too great to be overcome by Hu Tao's attempt at mind control. The light flickered and died, and Hu Tao's expression turned to one of shock and anger.\n\n\"You will not get away with this,\" she snarled, drawing her sword. \"I will not let you leave and ruin everything I have worked for.\"\n\nFilon knew he had no choice but to fight. He summoned his powers, his hair growing longer and his eyes glowing with energy as he prepared to defend himself. Hu Tao attacked fiercely, her sword flashing through the air as she tried to strike Filon down.\n\nBut Filon was more than a match for her. He moved with lightning speed, dodging and weaving around her attacks as he countered with powerful blasts of electricity. He used his technical knowledge to build and summon various gadgets and machines to aid in the fight, all the while keeping his calm and focusing on the task at hand.\n\nHu Tao was no amateur fighter, but Filon's superior skills and powers proved to be too much for her. She stumbled and fell, her sword clattering to the ground as Filon stood over her, panting and triumphant.\n\n\"It is over,\" Filon said, his voice filled with sadness and regret. \"I did not want it to come to this, but you left me no choice.\"\n\nHu Tao lay on the ground, defeated. Filon knew that he had no choice but to kill her, as she would never stop trying to stop him. He hesitated for a moment, not wanting to take a life, but in the end he knew it was necessary for his own survival. He raised his hand and sent a final burst of electricity coursing through Hu Tao's body, ending her life.\n\nThe Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, without a person to take over as director, collapses, and news of the mysterious newcomer slowly spreads around the world. Filon, feeling both guilty and relieved, sets off on a journey to make a new life for himself and find a way to make amends for the life he had taken.\n\nFilon decides to go to Mondstadt, as he has heard that it is a nation full of freedom and opportunity. He believes that he will be able to use his technical knowledge and superpowers to make a positive impact in the nation, and he is excited to explore all that Mondstadt has to offer. Additionally, the city's beauty and atmosphere appeal to Filon, and he feels drawn to its culture and values. Overall, Filon believes that Mondstadt is the perfect place for him to start his new life and make a difference in the world of Teyvat.", "length": 3508}

Names like Baboon Lodge and Porcupine Place were handpainted beside the wooden doors that led out to cobblestone paths, and the windows were left open so that guests woke up to the rustling of the jacaranda leaves and the steady calming crash of the sea\u2019s waves. The wicker trays held a selection of fine teas. At midmorning, discreet black maids made the bed, cleaned the elegant bathtub, vacuumed the carpet, and left wildflowers in handcrafted vases. Ujunwa found it odd that the African Writers Workshop was held here, at Jumping Monkey Hill, outside Cape Town. The name itself was incongruous, and the resort had the complacence of the well-fed about it, the kind of place where she imagined affluent foreign tourists would dart around taking pictures of lizards and then return home still mostly unaware that there were more black people than red-capped lizards in South Africa. Later, she would learn that Edward Campbell had chosen the resort; he had spent weekends there when he was a lecturer at the University of Cape Town years ago. But she didn\u2019t know this the afternoon Edward\u2014an old man in a summer hat who smiled to show two front teeth the color of mildew\u2014picked her up at the airport. He kissed her on both cheeks. He asked if she had had any trouble with her prepaid ticket in Lagos, if she minded waiting for the Ugandan whose flight would come soon, if she was hungry. He told her that his wife, Isabel, had already picked up most of the other workshop participants and that their friends Simon and Hermione, who had come with them from London as paid staff, were arranging a welcome lunch back at the resort. He and Ujunwa sat down on a bench in Arrivals. He balanced the sign with the Ugandan\u2019s name on his shoulder and told her how humid Cape Town was at this time of the year, how pleased he was about the workshop arrangements. He lengthened his words. His accent was what the British called \u201cposh,\u201d the kind some rich Nigerians tried to mimic and ended up sounding unintentionally funny. Ujunwa wondered if he was the one who had selected her for the workshop. Probably not; it was the British Council that had made the call for entries and then selected the best. Edward had moved a little and sat closer to her. He was asking what she did back home in Nigeria. Ujunwa faked a wide yawn and hoped he would stop talking. He repeated his question and asked whether she had taken leave from her job to attend the workshop. He was watching her intently. He could have been anything from sixty-five to ninety. She could not tell his age from his face; it was pleasant but unformed, as though God, having created him, had slapped him flat against a wall and smeared his features all over his face. She smiled vaguely and said that she had lost her job just before she left Lagos\u2014a job in banking\u2014and so there had been no need to take leave. She yawned again. He seemed keen to know more and she did not want to say more, and so when she looked up and saw the Ugandan walking toward them, she was relieved. The Ugandan looked sleepy. He was in his early thirties, square-faced and dark-skinned, with uncombed hair that had tightened into kinky balls. He bowed as he shook Edward\u2019s hand with both of his and then turned and mumbled a hello to Ujunwa. He sat in the front seat of the Renault. The drive to the resort was long, on roads haphazardly chiseled into steep hills, and Ujunwa worried that Edward was too old to drive so fast. She held her breath until they arrived at the cluster of thatch roofs and manicured paths. A smiling blond woman showed her to her cabin, Zebra Lair, which had a four-poster bed and linen that smelled of lavender. Ujunwa sat on the bed for a moment and then got up to unpack, looking out of the window from time to time to search the canopy of trees for lurking monkeys. There were none, unfortunately, Edward told the participants later, as they ate lunch under pink umbrellas on the terrace, their tables pushed close to the railing so that they could look down at the turquoise sea. He pointed at each person and did the introductions. The white South African woman was from Durban, while the black man came from Johannesburg. The Tanzanian man came fromArusha, the Ugandan man from Entebbe, the Zimbabwean woman from Bulawayo, the Kenyan man from Nairobi, and the Senegalese woman, the youngest at twenty-three, had flown in from Paris, where she attended university. Edward introduced Ujunwa last: \u201cUjunwa Ogundu is our Nigerian participant and she lives in Lagos.\u201d Ujunwa looked around the table and wondered with whom she would get along. The Senegalese woman was the most promising, with the irreverent sparkle in her eyes and the Francophone accent and the streaks of silver in her fat dreadlocks. The Zimbabwean woman had longer, thinner dreadlocks, and the cowries in them clinked as she moved her head from side to side. She seemed hyper, overactive, and Ujunwa thought she might like her, but only the way she liked alcohol\u2014in small amounts. The Kenyan and the Tanzanian looked ordinary, almost indistinguishable\u2014tall men with wide foreheads who were wearing tattered beards and shortsleeved patterned shirts. She thought she would like them in the uninvested way that one likes nonthreatening people. She wasn\u2019t sure about the South Africans: the white woman had a tooearnest face, humorless and free of makeup, and the black man looked patiently pious, like a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who went from door to door and smiled when each was shut in his face. As for the Ugandan, Ujunwa had disliked him from the airport, and did so even more now because of his toadying answers to Edward\u2019s questions, the way he leaned forward to speak only to Edward and ignored the other participants. They, in turn, said little to him. They all knew he was the winner of the last Lipton African Writers\u2019 Prize, with an award of fifteen thousand pounds. They didn\u2019t include him in the polite talk about their flights. After they ate the creamy chicken prettied with herbs, after they drank the sparkling water that came in glossy bottles, Edward stood up to give the welcoming address. He squinted as he spoke, and his thin hair fluttered in the breeze that smelled of the sea. He started by telling them what they already knew\u2014that the workshop would be for two weeks; that it was his idea but of course funded graciously by the Chamberlain Arts Foundation, just as the Lipton African Writers\u2019 Prize had been his idea and funded also by the good people at the foundation; that they were all expected to produce one story for possible publication in the Oratory; that laptops would be provided in the cabins; that they would write during the first week and review each participant\u2019s work during the second week; and that the Ugandan would be workshop leader. Then he talked about himself, how African literature had been his cause for forty years, a lifelong passion that started at Oxford. He glanced often at the Ugandan. The Ugandan nodded eagerly to acknowledge each glance. Finally Edward introduced his wife, Isabel, although they had all met her. He told them she was an animal rights activist, an old Africa hand who had spent her teenage years in Botswana. He looked proud when she stood up, as if her tall and lean gracefulness made up for what he lacked in appearance. Her hair was a muted red, cut so that wisps framed her face. She patted it as she said, \u201cEdward, really, an introduction.\u201d Ujunwa imagined, though, that Isabel had wanted that introduction, that perhaps she had even reminded Edward of it, saying, Now, dear, remember to introduce me properly at lunch. Her tone would have been delicate. The next day at breakfast, Isabel used just such a tone when she sat next to Ujunwa and said that surely, with that exquisite bone structure, Ujunwa had to come from Nigerian royal stock. The first thing that came to Ujunwa\u2019s mind was to ask if Isabel ever needed royal blood to explain the good looks of friends back in London. She did not ask that but instead said\u2014because she could not resist \u2014that she was indeed a princess and came from an ancient lineage and that one of her forebears had captured a Portuguese trader in the seventeenth century and kept him, pampered and oiled, in a royal cage. She stopped to sip her cranberry juice and smile into her glass. Isabel said, brightly, that she could always spot royal blood and she hoped Ujunwa would support her antipoaching campaign and it was just horrible, horrible, how many endangered apes people were killing and they didn\u2019t even eat them, never mind all that talk about bush meat, they just used the private parts for charms. After breakfast, Ujunwa called her mother and told her about the resort and about Isabel and was pleased when her mother chuckled. She hung up and sat in front of her laptop and thought about how long it had been since her mother had really laughed. She sat there for a long time, moving the mouse from side to side, trying to decide whether to name her character something common, like Chioma, or something exotic, like Ibari. Chioma lives with her mother in Lagos. She has a degree in economics from Nsukka, has recently finished her National Youth Service, and every Thursday she buys The Guardian and scours the employment section and sends out her CV in brown manila envelopes. She hears nothing for weeks. Finally she gets a phone call inviting her to an interview. After the first few questions, the man says he will hire her and then walks across and stands behind her and reaches over her shoulders to squeeze her breasts. She hisses, \u201cStupid man! You cannot respect yourself!\u201d and leaves. Weeks of silence follow. She helps out at her mother\u2019s boutique. She sends out more envelopes. At the next interview, the woman, speaking in the fakest, silliest accent Chioma has ever heard, tells her she wants somebody foreign-educated, and Chioma almost laughs as she leaves. More weeks of silence. Chioma has not seen her father in months, but she decides to go to his new office in Victoria Island to ask if he can help her find a job. Their meeting is tense. \u201cWhy have you not come since, eh?\u201d he asks, pretending to be angry, because she knows it is easier for him to be angry, it is easier to be angry with people after you have hurt them. He makes some calls. He gives her a thin roll of twohundred-naira notes. He does not ask about her mother. She notices that the Yellow Woman\u2019s photo is on his desk. Her mother had described her well: \u201cShe is very fair, she looks mixed, and the thing is that she is not even pretty, she has a face like an overripe yellow pawpaw.\u201d The chandelier in the main dining room of Jumping Monkey Hill hung so low that Ujunwa could extend her hand and touch it. Edward sat at one end of the long, white-covered table, Isabel at the other, and the participants in between. The hardwood floors thumped noisily as waiters walked around and handed out menus. Ostrich medallions. Smoked salmon. Chicken in orange sauce. Edward urged everyone to eat the ostrich. It was simply mah-ve-lous. Ujunwa did not like the idea of eating an ostrich, did not even know that people ate ostriches, and when she said so, Edward laughed good-naturedly and said that of course ostrich was an African staple. Everyone else ordered the ostrich, and when Ujunwa\u2019s chicken, too citrusy, came, she wondered if perhaps she should have had the ostrich. It looked like beef, anyway. She drank more alcohol than she had ever drunk in her life, two glasses of wine, and she felt mellowed and chatted with the Senegalese about the best ways to care for natural black hair: no silicone products, lots of shea butter, combing only when wet. She overheard snatches as Edward talked about wine: Chardonnay was horribly boring. Afterwards, the participants gathered in the gazebo\u2014except for the Ugandan, who sat away with Edward and Isabel. They slapped at flying insects and drank wine and laughed and teased one another: You Kenyans are too submissive! You Nigerians are too aggressive! You Tanzanians have no fashion sense! You Senegalese are too brainwashed by the French! They talked about the war in the Sudan, about the decline of the African Writers Series, about books and writers. They agreed that Dambudzo Marechera was astonishing, that Alan Paton was patronizing, that Isak Dinesen was unforgivable. The Kenyan put on a generic European accent and, between drags at his cigarette, recited what Isak Dinesen had said about all Kikuyu children becoming mentally retarded at the age of nine. They laughed. The Zimbabwean said Achebe was boring and did nothing with style, and the Kenyan said that was a sacrilege and snatched at the Zimbabwean\u2019s wineglass, until she recanted, laughing, saying of course Achebe was sublime.

Ujunwa began to jump up and down, babbling nonsense to mimic Conrad\u2019s Africans, feeling the sweet lightness of wine in her head. The Zimbabwean staggered and fell into the water fountain and climbed out spluttering, her dreadlocks wet, saying she had felt some fish wriggling around in there. The Kenyan said he would use that for his story\u2014 fish in the fancy resort fountain\u2014since he really had no idea what he was going to write about. The Senegalese said her story was really her story, about how she mourned her girlfriend and how her grieving had emboldened her to come out to her parents although they now treated her being a lesbian as a mild joke and continued to speak of the families of suitable young men. The black South African looked alarmed when he heard \u201clesbian.\u201d He got up and walked away. The Kenyan said the black South African reminded him of his father, who attended a Holy Spirit Revival church and didn\u2019t speak to people on the street because they were not saved. The Zimbabwean, Tanzanian, white South African, and Senegalese all spoke about their fathers. They looked at Ujunwa and she realized that she was the only one who had said nothing, and for a moment the wine no longer fogged her mind. She shrugged and mumbled that there was really little to say about her father. He was a normal person. \u201cIs he in your life?\u201d the Senegalese asked, with the soft tone that meant she assumed he was not, and for the first time her Francophone accent irritated Ujunwa. \u201cHe is in my life,\u201d Ujunwa said with a quiet force. \u201cHe was the one who bought me books when I was a child and the one who read my early poems and stories.\u201d She paused, and everyone was looking at her and she added, \u201cHe did something that surprised me. It hurt me, too, but mostly it surprised me.\u201d The Senegalese looked as if she wanted to ask more but changed her mind and said she wanted more wine. \u201cAre you writing about your father?\u201d the Kenyan asked and Ujunwa answered with an emphatic NO because she had never believed in fiction as therapy. The Tanzanian told her that all fiction was therapy, some sort of therapy, no matter what anybody said. That evening, Ujunwa tried to write, but her eyeballs were swimming and her head was aching and so she went to bed. After breakfast, she sat before the laptop and cradled a cup of tea. Chioma gets a call from Merchant Trust bank, one of the places her father contacted. He knows the chairman of the board. She is hopeful; all the bank people she knows drive nice secondhand Jettas and have nice flats in Gbagada. The deputy manager interviews her. He is dark and good-looking and his glasses have an elegant designer logo on the frames and, as he speaks to her, she desperately wishes he would notice her. He doesn\u2019t. He tells her that they would like to hire her to do marketing, which will mean going out and bringing in new accounts. She will be working with Yinka. If she can bring in ten million naira during her trial period, she will be guaranteed a permanent position. She nods as he speaks. She is used to men\u2019s attention and is sulky that he does not look at her as a man looks at a woman, and she does not quite understand what he means by going out to get new accounts until she starts the job two weeks later. A uniformed driver takes her and Yinka in an air-conditioned official Jeep\u2014she runs her hand over the smooth leather seat, is reluctant to climb out\u2014to the home of an alhaji in Ikoyi. The alhaji is avuncular and expansive with his smile, his hand gestures, his laughter. Yinka has already come to see him a few times before and he hugs her and says something that makes her laugh. He looks at Chioma. \u201cThis one is too fine,\u201d he says. A steward serves frosted glasses of chapman. The alhaji speaks to Yinka but looks often at Chioma. Then he asks Yinka to come closer and explain the high-interest savings accounts to him and then he asks her to sit on his lap and doesn\u2019t she think he\u2019s strong enough to carry her? Yinka says of course he is and sits on his lap, smiling a serene smile. Yinka is small and fair; she reminds Chioma of the Yellow Woman. What Chioma knows of the Yellow Woman is what her mother told her. One slow afternoon, the Yellow Woman had walked into her mother\u2019s boutique on Adeniran Ogunsanya Street. Her mother knew who the Yellow Woman was, knew the relationship with her husband had been on for a year, knew that he had paid for the Yellow Woman\u2019s Honda Accord and her flat in Ilupeju. But what drove her mother crazy was the insult of this: the Yellow Woman coming to her boutique, looking at shoes and planning to pay for them with money that really belonged to her husband. So her mother yanked at the Yellow Woman\u2019s weave-on that hung to her back and screamed \u201cHusband snatcher!\u201d and the salesgirls joined in, slapping and beating the Yellow Woman until she ran out to her car. When Chioma\u2019s father heard of it, he shouted at her mother and said she had acted like one of those wild women from the street, had disgraced him, herself, and an innocent woman for nothing. Then he left the house. Chioma came back from National Youth Service and noticed that her father\u2019s wardrobe was empty. Aunty Elohor, Aunty Rose, and Aunty Uche had all come and said to her mother, \u201cWe are prepared to go with you and beg him to come back home or we will go and beg on your behalf.\u201d Chioma\u2019s mother said, \u201cNever, not in this world. I am not going to beg him. It is enough.\u201d Aunty Funmi came and said the Yellow Woman had tied him up with medicine and she knew a good babalawo who could untie him. Chioma\u2019s mother said, \u201cNo, I am not going.\u201d Her boutique was failing, because Chioma\u2019s father had always helped her import shoes from Dubai. So she lowered prices, advertised in Joy and City People, and started stocking shoes made in Aba. Chioma is wearing a pair of those shoes the morning she sits in the alhaji\u2019s sitting room and watches Yinka, perched on the expansive lap, talking about the benefits of a savings account with Merchant Trust Bank. . . . At first, Ujunwa tried not to notice that Edward often stared at her body, that his eyes were never on her face but always lower. The workshop days had taken on a routine of breakfast at eight and lunch at one and dinner at six in the grand dining room. On the sixth day, a blisteringly hot day, Edward handed out copies of the first story to be reviewed, written by the Zimbabwean. The participants were all seated on the terrace, and after he handed out the papers, Ujunwa saw that all the seats under the umbrellas were occupied. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sitting in the sun,\u201d she said, already getting up. \u201cWould you like me to stand up for you, Edward?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather like you to lie down for me,\u201d he said. The moment was humid, thick; a bird cawed from far away. Edward was grinning. Only the Ugandan and the Tanzanian had heard him. Then the Ugandan laughed. And Ujunwa laughed, because it was funny and witty, she told herself, when you really thought about it. After lunch, she took a walk with the Zimbabwean and as they stopped to pick up shells by the sea, Ujunwa wanted to tell her what Edward had said. But the Zimbabwean seemed distracted, less chatty than usual; she was probably anxious about her story. Ujunwa read it that evening. She thought the writing had too many flourishes, but she liked the story and wrote appreciations and careful suggestions in the margins. It was familiar and funny, about a Harare secondary schoolteacher whose Pentecostal minister tells him that he and his wife will not have a child until they get a confession from the witches who have tied up his wife\u2019s womb. They become convinced that the witches are their next-door neighbors, and every morning they pray loudly, throwing verbal Holy Ghost bombs over the fence. After the Zimbabwean read an excerpt the next day, there was a short silence around the dining table. Then the Ugandan spoke and said there was much energy in the prose. The white South African nodded enthusiastically. The Kenyan disagreed. Some of the sentences tried so hard to be literary that they didn\u2019t make sense, he said, and he read one such sentence. The Tanzanian man said a story had to be looked at as a whole and not in parts. Yes, the Kenyan agreed, but each part had to make sense in order to form a whole that made sense. Then Edward spoke. The writing was certainly ambitious, but the story itself begged the question \u201cSo what?\u201d There was something terribly pass\u00e9 about it when one considered all the other things happening in Zimbabwe under the horrible Mugabe. Ujunwa stared at Edward. What did he mean by \u201cpass\u00e9\u201d? How could a story so true be pass\u00e9? But she did not ask what Edward meant and the Kenyan did not ask and the Ugandan did not ask and all the Zimbabwean did was shove her dreadlocks away from her face, cowries clinking. Everyone else remained silent. Soon they all began to yawn and say good night and walk to their cabins. The next day, they did not talk about the previous evening. They talked about how fluffy the scrambled eggs were and how eerie the jacaranda leaves that rustled against their windows at night were. After dinner, the Senegalese read from her story. It was a windy night and they shut the door to keep out the sound of the whirling trees. The smoke from Edward\u2019s pipe hung over the room. The Senegalese read two pages of a funeral scene, stopping often to sip some water, her accent thickening as she became more emotional, each t sounding like a z. Afterwards, everyone turned to Edward, even the Ugandan, who seemed to have forgotten that he was workshop leader. Edward chewed at his pipe thoughtfully before he said that homosexual stories of this sort weren\u2019t reflective of Africa, really. \u201cWhich Africa?\u201d Ujunwa blurted out. The black South African shifted on his seat. Edward chewed further at his pipe. Then he looked at Ujunwa in the way one would look at a child who refused to keep still in church and said that he wasn\u2019t speaking as an Oxford-trained Africanist, but as one who was keen on the real Africa and not the imposing of Western ideas on African venues. The Zimbabwean and Tanzanian and white South African began to shake their heads as Edward was speaking. \u201cThis may indeed be the year 2000, but how African is it for a person to tell her family that she is homosexual?\u201d Edward asked. The Senegalese burst out in incomprehensible French and then, a minute of fluid speech later, said, \u201cI am Senegalese! I am Senegalese!\u201d Edward responded in equally swift French and then said in English, with a soft smile, \u201cI think she had too much of that excellent Bordeaux,\u201d and some of the participants chuckled. Ujunwa was the first to leave. She was close to her cabin when she heard somebody call her and she stopped. It was the Kenyan. The Zimbabwean and the white South African were with him. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the bar,\u201d the Kenyan said. She wondered where the Senegalese was. In the bar, she drank a glass of wine and listened to them talk about how the other guests at Jumping Monkey Hill \u2014all of whom were white\u2014looked at the participants suspiciously. The Kenyan said a youngish couple had stopped and stepped back a little as he approached them on the path from the swimming pool the day before. The white South African said she got suspicious looks, too, perhaps because she wore only kente-print caftans. Sitting there, staring out into the black night, listening to the drink-softened voices around her, Ujunwa felt a self-loathing burst open in the bottom of her stomach. She should not have laughed when Edward said \u201cI\u2019d rather like you to lie down for me.\u201d It had not been funny. It had not been funny at all. She had hated it, hated the grin on his face and the glimpse of greenish teeth and the way he always looked at her chest rather than her face, the way his eyes climbed all over her, and yet she had made herself laugh like a deranged hyena. She put down her half-finished glass of wine and said, \u201cEdward is always looking at my body.\u201d The Kenyan and the white South African and Zimbabwean stared at her. Ujunwa repeated, \u201cEdward is always looking at my body.\u201d The Kenyan said it was clear from the first day that the man would be climbing on top of that flat stick of a wife and\n=== END OF CHUNK ===", "length": 3246}

It's that easy, and that hard.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve never written a novel before (and you don\u2019t have an MFA in creative writing), it's only understandable that you\u2019re daunted by the prospect of writing a book. This uncertainty is precisely why outlining systems, such as The Snowflake Method, are so appealing to developing writers.\n\nIf you want to find out how to use the snowflake method, feel free to skip ahead to this section. But if you have a moment, let\u2019s first look at the basics of this popular approach.\n\nWhat is the Snowflake Method?\nPyZkFcMjKJQ Video Thumb\nThe Snowflake Method is an approach to writing that encourages starting with the simplest premise possible. From there, you systematically expand it to include plot and character details. Developed by American author, physicist, and writing coach Randy Ingermanson, the method's end result is a comprehensive character bible and scene list with which an author can begin the first draft.\n\n\u201cMy power flurries through the air into the ground. My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around\u201d \u2014 \u201cLet It Go\u201d from Disney\u2019s Frozen\n\nGiven Ingermanson\u2019s background as a computational physicist, it should come as no surprise that his method was inspired by a mathematical principle known as a fractal. In particular, he references the Koch Snowflake to demonstrate how your story grows with each subsequent stage of the planning process.\n\nIt's probably no surprise to you to learn that every writer uses a different outline. If you're curious about the general outlining process, we dive deeper into the topic in this post on how to outline a novel. (Feel free to grab the free book outline template in there as well!) But for now, let's talk about the advantages of this particular method.\n\nWhat are the benefits of the snowflake method?\nFans of Ingermanson\u2019s method tend to enjoy how structured the process is. Not only does he lay out practical steps for outlining, but he also gives an idea of how long each step should take. For example, he suggests spending an hour on the very first step of honing a single-sentence story summary. Later on, when writing a character bible, he recommends spending a few hours on each character.\nimage credit: Damian McCoig @ Unsplash\nThe Snowflake Method also identifies and fixes a common cause of Abandoned First Draft Syndrome: plot holes. It\u2019s common for writers to be 20,000 words into a first draft before noticing major story issues that they need to go back and fix.\n\nBy working toward a scene list and, more importantly, synopses for every character, you can better identify plot holes before you even start chapter one. If the butler commits a murder in Chapter 20, you can make sure he isn\u2019t imprisoned for life in Chapter 12.\n\nWith the help of the Snowflake Method, many writers have been able to follow-through and complete a draft of their novel where previously they may have failed.\n\nHow to use the Snowflake Method to write a novel (in 6 steps)\nWithout giving away every detail of Ingermanson\u2019s process, here\u2019s a quick look at how you can use the snowflake method to write a novel:\n\nStep 1: Write a one-sentence story summary\nEncapsulate what your novel is about in a single sentence. You might also call this \u2018the hook\u2019: a line that you can use in almost any situation to get anybody interested in your book.\nA revenge-obsessed whaler embarks on a deadly voyage to hunt the beast that took his leg.\n\nOr\n\nWhisked away to a magical boarding school, an orphaned boy discovers that he\u2019s a famous wizard.\n\nThis practice will be closely related to the theme of your novel. When constructing this single sentence, it\u2019s important to avoid specifics. A character\u2019s name isn\u2019t as useful as a reference to their personal goal, for example. For this step, writers are urged to keep their sentence under 15-words long.\n\nStep 2: Expand it to a one-paragraph summary\n\nIf you are imagining the snowflake metaphor, this is when the triangle turns into a star. Building off the details in your one-sentence summary, add a few elements here and there until you have retold your story in five sentences.\n\nThis is where you will introduce your major plot points. If you\u2019re a fan of the three-act structure, you\u2019ll want to include:\n\nThe exposition (what is the status quo at the start of the story)\nThe first plot point (what major event kicks off the story),\nThe mid-point (where things take a turn for the worse), and\nPlot point two (where your character hits rock-bottom and starts turning things around)\nClimax and denouement (how the story resolves)\nIt\u2019s worth putting time into getting this summary just right. You can always come back to revise it if things change, but having these plot signposts in place will help guide the next few steps.\n\nStep 3. Start small with your characters\n\nNow that you\u2019ve started expanding your view of the plot, Ingermanson suggests shifting down a gear and painting your characters with broad brushstrokes.\n\nThis is where you identify all the major characters in your book, give them names and spend an hour identifying their:\n\nMotivations (what drives them in life)\nGoals (what non-abstract things do they want)\nConflict (what prevents them from achieving their goal)\nEpiphany (how they overcome that conflict)\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind both external and internal conflict. If a character\u2019s goal is to get that big promotion, then their conflict might be with the bully from HR (external conflict) and their own self-confidence (internal conflict).\n\nAt the end of this stage, you\u2019ll have an idea of the major players\u2019 character arcs.\n\nStep 4. Expand your one-paragraph summary into a single page\n\nIngermanson sees this stage as taking a few hours, as you blow out each sentence of your one-paragraph summary (step 2) into a full paragraph. To develop your story into blocks that are easy to understand and write, you can end every paragraph with what he calls a \u2018disaster\u2019 \u2014 which you might interpret as a major plot point or a cliffhanger.\n\nStep 5. Character bibles and character synopses\n\nThis is the first stage where you, the story designer, will roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty. Armed with your short character summaries and your one-page plot, you will now create a one-page dossier for each major character (and a half-page for the minor ones).\n\nIf you want a bit more guidance, you can find various online guides to fleshing out characters, or download and fill out this free character profile template. By going deep into your major characters\u2019 backstories, you\u2019ll likely discover reasons why they might behave in a certain way during your story.\n\nOnce your character bible is complete, you then write a synopsis for each character. This involves outlining each character\u2019s journey through the novel. This is perhaps one of the most useful parts of the snowflake method \u2014 especially when you\u2019re writing for plot-heavy genres such as mystery or suspense. What a character knows at any given point in the book will factor heavily into whether the story \u2018works\u2019.\n\nSo let\u2019s take stock: you have a long synopsis, character bibles, and fleshed-out story threads for each character. This leaves only one step in your preparation.\n\nStep 6. Write a four-page synopsis and scene list\n\nRemember how you expanded every sentence of your short synopsis into paragraphs to form your long synopsis? Here, you effectively do the same: taking every paragraph from the long synopsis and letting them breathe over a page each. Naturally, you might get the urge to write more descriptively, but resist that urge and keep every sentence just as tightly focused as before.\n\nAnd then, last of all, you\u2019ll want to draft out a scene list, where you detail exactly what will happen in every scene of your book.\n\n-----------------------------\nSo, first question is... what is the difference between the two methods descibed above? Also, how can I take what I already have written and adapt it to the second method? What parts do I still need to do?", "length": 3769}

The EP is the solo piano companion to Blais\u2019 highly successful and loved album \u201cAubades\u201d, released this past February.\n\u201cSerenades\u201d is the nocturnal companion to the brightness of \u201cAubades\u201d, and features intimate and atmospheric solo piano versions of key tracks from the album, including \u201cAmour\u201d, \u201cOuessant\u201d, and \u201cMurmures\u201d. It also features three new tracks: \u201c117 (Bach)\u201d, \u201cLa Chute\u201d, and \u201cMorning (Improv)\u201d. \u201cLa Chute\u201d (\u201cThe Fall\u201d) was especially composed for the left hand, due to a right arm injury Blais suffered after falling on ice before a performance. This inspired him to write this piece particularly for the left hand. The first single \u201cOuessant\u201d (Piano) is a melancholic slow wander through luminous and soothing solo piano soundscapes.\n\u201cSerenades\u201d is a testament to Blais\u2019 musical prowess and ability to create captivating and moving musical landscapes. It\u2019s sure to be a stunning addition to Blais\u2019 already impressive discography.\n\n---\n\nI have written it based on the following information:\n\nJEAN-MICHEL BLAIS DECCA BIO:\nJean-Michel Blais - Biography\n \nJean-Michel Blais is a post-classical pianist and composer living in Montreal, Canada.\n \nBlais grew up in a rural French Catholic town in Quebec and began tinkering on his family's organ at age 9. By 11, he began writing original compositions and taking piano lessons. A natural talent, by 17 he was invited to the Trois-Rivieres Music Conservatory and began training as a classical pianist. The constraints of formal training began to wear on Blais who started to gravitate towards experimentation and improvisation. He eventually left the school and put aside his musical path.\n \nIn his mid-20s, Blais traveled to Europe and Latin America, studied special education, liberal arts and psychology, while moving to Berlin for about a year and six months in Buenos Aires, before settling in Montreal where he rediscovered his love for composing and performing, which caught the ear of Toronto-based indie label Arts & Crafts.\n \nBlais\u2019 debut album, Il, was written and recorded in his apartment over two years of daily improvisations. It was released on April 8, 2016, and amassed over 50 million streams worldwide, reaching #1 on Billboard\u2019s Classical chart in Canada 14 times, earning a Polaris Music Prize long list nomination and a spot on Time Magazine\u2019s Top ten albums of 2016.\n \nThe following year, Blais performed at the prestigious Red Bull Music Academy in collaboration with Grammy-nominated producer CFCF. This spurred a partnership between the two musicians that yielded Cascades, a collaborative EP released on March 15, 2017. The release earned praises for its brave interplay between piano and electronics, including by the likes of Pitchfork and BBC Radio 6.\n \nAfter a year of touring North America and Europe, Blais began working on his sophomore album, Dans ma main. Released on May 11, 2018. Jean-Michel Blais\u2019 Dans ma main is an expansive album of post-classical piano music with strands of electronic detail. Recorded at night in a Steinway & Sons piano shop, Blais blends his classical skill and precise pop sensibility with synthetic accompaniment, which creates unique environments where the piano\u2019s intimacy can be subtly disrupted at any time. Dans ma main earned a Polaris Music Prize short list nomination.\n \nFascinated with the cathartic response of worldwide audiences to his pin-drop performances, Blais considers how music has served as a tool of wellness in his own life: from his early career in special education, to his parents\u2019 use of ambient music to soothe the Tourettic symptoms he\u2019s been suffering from since childhood. On Dans ma main, Jean-Michel calls upon these periods of his life, reimagining a serenity that he previously found only seated at a piano.\n \nIn the spring of 2018, when asked by his landlord to leave his beloved apartment where he recorded his debut album Il, Blais invited friends and family in his bedroom to take part into an intimate series of home concert and recording sessions, which gave birth to his sophomore EP, Eviction sessions, released on Novembre 18, 2018.\n---\nTIMELINE FOR \u201cSERENADES\u201d:\n(8 July - amour (piano) - out already)\n18 Nov: ouessant (piano) - Single 2 (no EP announcement)\n20-29 Jan: Concerts in Toronto, NYC & Quebec - should EP be announced by the 20th?\n3 Feb: EP announcement & la chute (Single 3)\n10 Mar: serenades EP release + yanni (piano) - focus track\n---\n \n \nTRACKLIST FOR \u201cSERENADES\u201d:\n117 (bach)\namour (piano)\nla chute\nmorning (improv)\nfl\u00e2neur (piano)\nyanni (piano)\nouessant (piano)\nmurmures (piano)\n---\n \n---\n \n---\nJEAN-MICHEL BLAIS PREVIOUS ALBUM \u201caubades\u201d:\naubades, the new album from post-classical piano icon Jean-Michel Blais, marks the Montreal-born musician\u2019s transition from pianist to composer, as he writes for an ensemble for the first time in his career. Written during the pandemic and following a breakup, Blais has used his distinctive musical voice to create a defiantly uplifting record with glistening instrumental textures and warm major tonalities. The album\u2019s title refers to the \u201caubade\u201d, a Middle Ages morning love song about lovers separating at daybreak, a dawn serenade.\n \nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a \u201cfruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.\u201d Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass string.\n---\nBACKGROUND ARTICLE (ON CLASSIC FM SITE) ON THE HISTORY OF PIECES FOR LEFT HAND PIANO\n \nThe best classical music for piano left hand\n12 August 2014, 12:56 | Updated: 6 January 2017, 14:45\n \nFacebook share Twitter share\nIn celebration of International Left Handers Day, we're investigating the top ten pieces of piano music composed specifically for the left hand, as chosen by one-handed piano virtuoso, Nicholas McCarthy.\n \n1. Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\n \nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\n \n \n \n \n \n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\n \nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Sa\u00ebns' left hand \u00e9tudes religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\n \n \n \n \n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\n \nADVERTISING\n \nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\n \n \n \n \n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\n \nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's \u00e9tudes - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate \u00e9tudes to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire \u00e9tude for left hand solo.\n \n \n \n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\n \nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\n \n \n \n \n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\n \nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\n \n \n \n \n7. Diversions - Britten\n \nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\n \n \n \n \n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\n \nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\n \n \n \n9. Six \u00e9tudes for the left hand - Saint-Sa\u00ebns\n \nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Sa\u00ebns' piano \u00e9tudes are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\n \n \n \n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\n \nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano.\n---\nKEY INFO ON THE NEW ALBUM:\n \nKEY INFO\n \nnew single ouessant (piano) is a melancholic slow wander through luminous and soothing solo piano soundscapes\nannouncing 10 Jan: s\u00e9r\u00e9nades is the solo piano companion EP to the highly-successful and loved album aubades (album of vibrant, sweeping works for chamber ensemble released this past February 2022)\ns\u00e9r\u00e9nades is the nocturnal companion to the brightness of aubades\ninspired by Franz Liszt\u2019s solo piano reductions\nfeatures intimate & atmospheric solo piano versions of key tracks from aubades - amour, ouessant, murmures\nfeatures three new tracks - 117 (bach), la chute, morning (improv)\nla chute (\u2018the fall\u2019) - composed for the left hand due to a right arm injury after falling on ice before a performance; this inspired him to write this piece particularly for left hand\ninfluencer duet campaign to follow for la chute - inviting people to provide their right-hand duet with Jean-Michel\n--", "length": 3288}
{"prompt": "ENTRY 6\n\nSo, here is the thing with ansibles. We don\u2019t actually know how they work.\nThey\u2019re not supposed to work. There is absolutely no way to explain instantaneous Faster-than-Light communication. They\u2019re not even that reliable for that. All we know is that if we place the terminals around the perimeters of Co-Op space in a relative sphere, they can be used as repeaters, and they can be used to triangulate locations in Co-Op space. They can be used as navigational beacons for ships using the A-Drive between systems. This is what nobody wants to admit. It\u2019s not science. It\u2019s some kind of space woo woo. We haven\u2019t figured out the science yet.\nWell.\nWe\u2019ve tried.\nThe closest we can come to a theoretical underpinning is some anonymous submit\u2019s ramblings about \u201cSimultaneity,\u201d but that\u2019s generally considered crackpot physics, along the lines of ancient aliens. We\u2019re not writing science fiction here.\nBut aside from that, there is no theoretical underpinning to how they function, we\u2019ve made guesses at best. See for yourself in the posts on the Library BBSs, there\u2019s fork after fork of proofs that all get downvoted into oblivion.\nThe best we can do:\nWe got ansibles from the Nadiran, who don\u2019t know how they work either (or if they do, they\u2019re never going to tell us). We don\u2019t know where they got them from.\nAnd at some point, Earth got ansibles from us.\nAnd ansibles are what my father specialized in. Much deeper than I ever went. \n\nFor a while after we got the ansible from the Nadiran, ansibles were all the rage, every syndicate wanted the jump on pushing their own mods. Eventually, we found we couldn\u2019t get any to work but the ones we\u2019d back-engineered, seemingly the slightest variance on the design made them useless pieces of junk. The best we can hope for is that Earth and the All Worlds Coalition don\u2019t figure out the ansible before we do.\nMy father was at an ansible relay out on the fringes of the far side of the Perimeter, when every board on every comm station up and down the Perimeter suddenly went off. \nWe didn\u2019t see what happened; we had no idea.\nI was 12 when he died - though I can probably count on one hand the number of times I\u2019d seen him. \nMy father was out there on EVA, walking along the relay station, when the spinning blades appeared from practically nowhere, and disappeared again, but not before turning him into space paste. They retrieved his helmet, that\u2019s all that could be retrieved. He was one of some 5 Co-Oppers lost that day. We were lucky. A whole world in Nadiran space wasn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m going to assume that you know about the Machine Plague what everyone knows. \nNothing would ever be the same again.\nAt the spinmost side of the Perimeter, a little further Rimward of our core space (but where we kept an ansible relay, and not far from where the Nadiran kept their rimward-most listening station) the machines swooped down like locusts, destroyed anything in their path, and then they were gone again. \nAnd for much of the region, the trouble was only beginning. \nWithin a few years, Nadiran trade had collapsed in the region of space most adjacent to the appearances of the Machine Plague. This left famine in its wake.\nThe Co-Op went and took up the lanes in its stead, set up its own arcologies and production, and employed the locals left by the Nadiran to just twist in the wind. Some people weren\u2019t too happy about this, but all in all, there haven\u2019t been that many complaints, and we even have plenty of Altikhari and D\u2019agra spacers now. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. The people most unhappy about this are some of the humans in the Intersystem Transport Syndicate. \nAnd\u2026 the rest of us have, by and large, gone on with our lives.\nWith the result that if you grew up within Co-Op space any time within the last 20 years, you\u2019ve had a very, very different life from anything like I came up in. From the lifetime of your own parents, or the lifetime of any Light-Chaser.\nWhen the Machine Plague ever returns, for all we know, we\u2019ll be back to square one. We don\u2019t even know where the damned thing comes from, what it comes out of. \nBut if there\u2019s ever a chance at finding out, there\u2019s a chance ansibles will tell us, will give us the proof.\nBecause whatever reason it is that ansibles actually work, and however it is that these things came from seemingly nowhere (except it isn\u2019t nowhere, I\u2019ve already blown a decade of my life on this problem), I\u2019ve got years\u2019 worth of schematics and proofs that point to the same possible reason. I\u2019m surprised R\u2019Kesh didn\u2019t just give up on me during those years.\nBut for a long time, I had no idea that the closest we\u2019ve gotten to anything that could be a key, is in Novayan loresong. To humans, to the human peer review groups and the research syndicates, that\u2019s just \u201calien woo-woo.\u201d \n\n ENTRY 7\n\nIt\u2019s from R\u2019Kesh that I first heard about the Ways across the Void. Rreh tharri Kith\u2019anna. Some older Novayans were steadfast in their belief in Traversable Anomalies, as attested by what songs remained from before they set foot on Novaya. \nThe night we first talked about it: it was during that first flight together, some months before Landing Day, before we got together in port. It\u2019s also memorable because it was the first real conversation we\u2019d ever had.\nI was sitting in the corner of the mess during Midwatch with my noise-cancelers on, and I was doing the thing I usually did off shift\u2026 work on my ratings, but in this case, it was a project to present to the Deep Space Expedition Syndicate\u2019s threads on the Library BBS. \nAfter catching my breath for several moments, I looked up. A foil package appeared next to my books at the table.\nMy stomach clenched with dread. This is where I came to study during Midwatch, was I going to lose this place? Have to start hiding in my hab pod? I expected the intruder to insert themselves into my space at the table, steeled myself for the intrusive questions, preparing the answer I\u2019d have, trying to make it as toothless as I could, and whatever the case might be, my work was done for the night.\nI looked up: it was R\u2019Kesh.\nHe simply stood, and didn\u2019t sit down at the table like I expected to: he looked like he was going to walk off.\nAfter my motioning to the seat, he eased himself into it, leaning over briefly to look at my work. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the Ansible Problem,\u201d he said: \u201cRating in Astronav? Somewhere along the line, we all have to do the Ansible Problem. It\u2019s funny for a Novayan, ay\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNope. Personal project,\u201d I replied, though for a moment, I imagined being up \u2013 alone \u2013 in the astronav dome, and filed that thought away for a while.\n\u201cJoining DSES?\u201d he asked \u2013 referring to the Deep Space Expedition Syndicate. (I didn\u2019t know how seriously to take this question, DSES was still taken as something of a joke at that point in time.)\n\u201cHell no,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for hours. You don\u2019t sleep, ay?\u201d\n\u201cCould say the same for you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe just take naps,\u201d R\u2019Kesh replied. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\u201cI WAS busy! I\u2019m going to have to start this whole thing over!\u201d\nI slammed the book closed and crossed my arms.\n\u201cMaybe eat first, ay?\u201d he said.\nI looked at the package: it was a packaged spicy salmon onigiri. My stomach growled; I hadn\u2019t moved from this spot for hours. I ripped the package open and proceeded to indelicately stuff my face. I wanted to be mad at him for the disruption but by this point, I couldn\u2019t be mad at the person who\u2019d brought me food.\nAfter a long time, after washing all of that down with a bulb of now-cold green tea, I wiped my mouth, and finally looked up at R\u2019Kesh and asked: \u201cFunny for a Novayan?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cYou said\u2026 having to do the Ansible Problem, is funny for a Novayan.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yes!\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say anything for a while.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just destroy my work for the night so that I\u2019m gonna have to start over, drop that on me, and not tell me about it.\u201d\nHe chuckled. But then, just as quickly, he was solemn. \u201cR\u2019Kesh humbly asks the Sparks\u2019 forgiveness. I will stay out of your space next time you are reading.\u201d\nI crossed my arms again. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you if you tell me why the Ansible Problem is so damned funny to a Novayan!\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, \u201cWalk with me?\u201d\nI grabbed the book off the table, stuffed it in my bag, and crumpled up the foil onigiri wrapper in one hand. \u201cLead the way.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI probably should have just gone back to my hab and gone to bed, but instead, I had walked with this Novayan down to the hydroponics lab. We sat in a corner in the arboretum, huddled against the wall, and he spoke softly and at length.\nI\u2019d already known somewhat about Novayan loresong; it\u2019s something lots of spacers know, we have our superstitions. More spacer custom comes to us from the Novayans than most of the humans in the syndicates want to admit.\nBut most humans don\u2019t take Novayan loresong seriously. Before being close to the brothers, I didn\u2019t know how seriously to take it, myself.\nBut a much more obscure loresong, it turned out, alluded to tunnels through space, through which they\u2019d sailed fairly lower tech ships, and that this is how they settled their world. He sang a couple of the songs he knew - first playing the tune on his blue ocarina, then singing it in Novayan, with an explanation of what each lyric meant.\n[Edit: put some of those lyrics here.]\nAfter some time, he put his ocarina down, and said:\n\u201cWe have no proof, of course. We would not even know how to look now. But any Novayan would love to be the one to find the proof. It\u2019s something any navigator likes to know about. I would love to go through, one day.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be insane if you want to do that.\u201d\n\u201cNnh.\u201d\nWe were quiet for a moment. \n\u201cSo what is the Sparks\u2019 interest in wormholes, then?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWormholes are the only possible way the ansibles could work. It\u2019s treated like\u2026 junk science. Better people than me have tried. It\u2019s just going to take actual investigation. I hope they get to it before another Machine Plague comes. I\u2019ve seen some of the feeds. Over, over, over. We still don\u2019t have enough empirical data. Not yet. Without that, anything posted to any of the syndicate boards, will just get downvoted into oblivion. And without upvotes, it doesn\u2019t pass to a vote in a syndicate-\u201c\n\u201cNnh. We\u2019ve stayed out of it,\u201d R\u2019Kesh said. \u201cSomehow. Sounds like we are not missing-\u201d\n\u201c-and without a syndicate supermajority, nobody releases the resources or bothers with their time. DSES is the only syn that will give it the time of day, and they\u2019ve got what? A little office on Perimeter Four?\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly have much \u2018deep space\u2019 to go to,\u201d R\u2019Kesh said. \u201cOr much way to get there.\u201d\n\u201cWe? Don\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\u201cAssociate syndic. What do you have against DSES anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThey keep downvoting me. Deleting my forks. One of them even forked my proposal and tried to push it through themselves, with their own ideas.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it WORKS, Vahl!\u201d\nWe didn\u2019t say anything for a while, and finally, we got up.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you, was it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was not me. How many syndicate forums do you post in, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cA lot.\u201d\nSo this is where I stop right here. Because I am getting off on a tangent, and none of this is going to tell you a single goddamned thing about how I ended up trapped on Planet Bullshit and became head of R&D for an aspiring rocket tyrant. Or about a single thing you actually needed to know.\nBut wormholes have something to do with it.\nAnd so does R\u2019Kesh.", "length": 3122}

While the desire to improve behaviors towards care can be traced back thousands of years, it's only recently that the sciences and systems for doing so at scale have become available. In this book, we will explore the ten principles of carePhysics and the evidence-based science behind them. We will review over 50 use cases across multiple markets and conditions to help put these principles into context. Additionally, we will outline practical strategies and systems for implementing these principles quickly and in a way that fits into today's human workflow.\n\nWe would like to express our gratitude for the amazing dedication of researchers, behavioral specialists, providers, clinicians, caregivers, chaplains, families, and patients who have passionately shared their time, frontline insights, and experiences to help identify the need for these principles. Their contributions have been invaluable in shaping the direction of carePhysics and in helping us all work towards a more effective, compassionate, and equitable healthcare system.\nAs we will share in principle number 4, communication, carePhysics emphasizes the value of how metaphors can help strengthen understanding and connection. \nLet\u2019s use a metaphor to help set the stage.\nJust as a symphony is made up of different instruments and sections that work together to create beautiful music, carePhysics is made up of different principles and strategies that work together to create positive outcomes in healthcare. Each principle and strategy is like an instrument, playing its own unique part in the overall composition. The holistic care principle is like the melody, providing a foundation for the other principles to build upon. The behavioral influence principle is like the rhythm section, providing structure and momentum. The communication principle is like the harmonies, creating a sense of connection and unity. And the technology and AI principles are like the instruments of the orchestra, adding depth and complexity to the overall sound.\n\nIn order to help organizations make meaningful change at scale, we've organized the 10 principles of carePhysics into two categories. Principles 1-5, which we call \"Idealisms\", align with an organization's values. Principles 6-10, which we call \"Implementation\" principles, use automation to put those ideals into action, capturing your team's wisdom and experiences and overcoming friction.\n\nFinally, we wrap up this introduction with a summary of the nine value-based outcomes that organizations can expect to achieve through this omnichannel approach. By harnessing the power of technology and artificial intelligence, we believe that these principles can create profound change and drive better outcomes for all involved in the care process.\nIntroduction:\ncarePhysics integrates proven and accepted theoretical models and programs from various fields, including sociology, psychology, economics, and healthcare management to provide a comprehensive approach to the challenges faced by the healthcare system. The 10 principles of carePhysics provide a clear evidence-based approach to supporting the social, emotional, physical, legal, financial, and medical aspects of an individual's well.\nThe principles are designed to improve communication, foster a sense of community, strengthen relationships, awareness, and promote positive behaviors, creating a culture of care that is centered on empathy, compassion, and inclusivity with a shared goal of improved outcomes. The adoption of carePhysics involves integrating the expertise and values of healthcare providers to effectively support goals utilizing technology, AI, and data analysis to enhance the delivery of care within the current human workflow.\nBy utilizing these tools, carePhysics can help identify and adjust patterns of communication and influence within healthcare organizations leading to improved communication and collaboration.. This leads to better patient outcomes, decreased healthcare costs, and increased job satisfaction for healthcare providers.\nCare physics distinguishes itself from other approaches to addressing care challenges by presenting the principles for improvement in a clear, easy to understand manner with real-world examples for implementation. It also provides practical strategies for integrating technology to attain long-held objectives and principles in an efficient and measurable way with a level of scalability and personal connection that was previously unattainable.\nCarePhysics is a unique and comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges facing the healthcare system. By integrating proven theoretical models and programs from various fields, such as sociology, psychology, economics, and healthcare management, the 10 principles of carePhysics offer an evidence-based approach to addressing the social, emotional, physical, legal, financial, and medical aspects of an individual's well-being.\n\nAt the core of carePhysics is the goal of creating a culture of care that fosters empathy, compassion, and inclusivity, while also promoting positive behaviors and improving communication. Through the adoption of carePhysics, healthcare providers can effectively integrate their expertise and values with technology, AI, and data analysis to enhance the delivery of care within the current human workflow.\n\nOne of the key benefits of carePhysics is its ability to identify and adjust patterns of communication and influence within healthcare organizations. This leads to improved communication and collaboration, which ultimately results in better patient outcomes, decreased healthcare costs, and increased job satisfaction for healthcare providers.\n\nWhat sets carePhysics apart from other approaches to addressing care challenges is its clear, easy-to-understand principles and practical strategies for implementation. The use of real-world examples and technology integration provides a scalable and personal approach to achieving long-held objectives and principles in an efficient and measurable way. Overall, carePhysics offers a transformative approach to healthcare that can positively impact the lives of patients, providers, and the healthcare system as a whole.\n10 Principles, 9 Outcomes, 1 Goal. A brief overview\nIn this section we define the 10 principles. The 9 outcomes that can come from implantation and 1 goal that resonates from all aspect of care. \nThe first five principles represent idealisms, based on science, theories, and models, which describe a ideal interactions with the right training and resources.\nPrinciples in Motion:\nThe remaining five principles, 6 through 10, are designed to put these idealisms into action, at scale, and in a way that enriches the culture of care. They offer systems and strategies for doing so that fit into today's workflow.\n\nMeet Pat & Casey, Characters, and Storytelling: \nTo help internalize these principles, we will follow the healthcare journey of two individuals. Pat is a 58-year-old with COPD who has experienced multiple hospitalizations, and Casey is a discharge coordinator at a local hospital. The use of story telling with example characters helps us visualize, empathize and understand how concepts we read about can helps learn and process what we need to understand. \n\nIdealisms: Principals based on science, theory, models \nThe first five principles focus on the idealistic foundation of carePhysics, which many readers may already be familiar with or wish to implement. While these idealisms are essential, their true value lies in effectively integrating them into practice. Fortunately, advancements in technology and strategies have enabled us to develop systems that complement human workflow, allowing us to transform these principles into actionable steps.\n\n1. Holistic Care: To treat the whole person, not just their physical condition, by addressing the social, emotional, physical, legal, financial, and medical aspects of an individual's well-being, in order to achieve the best possible outcomes. By taking a holistic approach, we can help patients and their families address all of their needs and concerns, leading to better health outcomes and a more satisfied patient population.\nPat and Casey:\nCasey identifies Pat's worry about finances during his hospitalization. By taking a holistic approach, Ideally Casey connects Pat with a social worker to explore financial assistance options and address his other non-medical concerns.\n\n2. Awareness: To ensure that patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers clearly understand the problem, what needs to happen, why it's important, how, and when actions need to be taken to achieve positive outcomes. By creating a shared understanding and common language, we can foster clear communication and collaboration between all stakeholders in the care process, leading to more effective care.\nPat and Casey:\nIdeally Casey has time and resources that helps Pat understand the importance of COPD management and informs him about available resources. With increased awareness, Pat feels empowered to take control of his health journey.\n\n3. Behavioral Influence: To influence change through the use of various \"levers\" such as understanding, social influence, humor, purpose and reinforced through techniques in asking questions. By understanding how to influence people's behavior in a positive way, we can help to achieve better outcomes in care and promote healthier lifestyles.\nPat and Casey:\nIdeally Casey could encourage Pat to participate in local support groups and involve his family in his care. By connecting Pat with others facing similar challenges, he feels less isolated and more supported.\n4. Communication: To promote positive communication strategies and techniques in care, including interactions, messaging, conversations, and addressing issues such as burnout, hope, and learned helplessness. By providing training and integrating effective communication, we can help to create an environment of trust, respect, and collaboration that leads to better care outcomes.\nPat and Casey:\nIdeally Casey listens empathetically to Pat's frustrations and concerns, creating a trusting environment for open dialogue. This effective communication strengthens their relationship, fostering collaboration in Pat's care.\n\n5. Community: To facilitate connections and foster a sense of support within the community, including family, caregivers, and community partners, by providing care in a collaborative and inclusive manner. By building strong connections within the community, healthcare providers can create a sense of trust and support.\nPat and Casey:\nIdeally Casey connects Pat with local services like meal programs and walking groups, fostering a sense of community support. These connections help Pat feel more engaged and empowered in his healthcare journey.\nImplementation: Principals for ideals into motion \nAs we delve into the next five principles, we'll explore how they build upon one another, facilitating meaningful change in a swift and efficient manner. These implementation-focused principles provide the necessary tools and resources to translate idealistic concepts into practical, real-world applications, enhancing the overall healthcare experience\n\n6. Engagements: Utilize proven design strategies and engagement models that support the ideals identified in Principles 1-5 to facilitate supportive content and engagements that align with the values and strategies of carePhysics. By designing content that is engaging, relevant, inclusive and easy to understand, healthcare providers can make care more accessible and effective for patients and caregivers.\n\nPat and Casey:\nCasey shares tailored videos and articles with Pat, engaging him in discussions about holistic care and self-management. This approach keeps Pat involved in his care and provides valuable insights for future interactions.\n\n7. Pathways: Develop outcomes-based pathways that leverage an organization's expertise and existing resources to orchestrate the delivery of engagements and content designed to address the specific needs of patients and families. Incorporating Principles 1-6, improves design efficiency, effectiveness and personalization.\nPat and Casey:\nA personalized care pathway, using mobile devices and checklists, seamlessly integrates into Pat's daily life. This helps him keep track of tasks and goals while continuously supporting him through his healthcare journey.\n\n8. Technology: This principle emphasizes the use of technology to streamline the care process and provide holistic, personalized, sequenced engagements that encourage compliance and meaningful data collection. Real-time feedback loops save time, strengthen connections in care, and provide frictionless options for support and change.\nPat and Casey:\nPat and Casey use technology to monitor health data and facilitate communication. Real-time feedback enables better decision-making and encourages positive behavior from both Pat and his support network.\n\n9. Care AI: This principle emphasizes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to make care more human and personalized. By analyzing data and making predictions about patient needs, AI can generate personalized content and engagements that are tailored to each patient's unique needs and preferences, resulting in more targeted and effective care. Additionally, AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up healthcare team members to use their personal skills and expertise, while reducing costs and improving patient outcomes.\nPat and Casey:\nAI assists Casey by suggesting personalized interventions based on Pat's needs and past interactions. During coaching sessions, Casey receives real-time guidance, empowering her to make a difference in Pat's care.\n10. Scoring: This principle is about evaluating engagements and content for prediction and improvement, utilizing the Jack scale (-5 poor to +5 excellent). By scoring engagement and content, healthcare providers can identify areas for improvement, track progress, and make better decisions about how to improve care outcomes.\nPat and Casey:\nUsing the Jack scale, Pat's healthcare experience is evaluated, allowing for continuous improvement in care delivery. Pat's feedback helps the team refine their approach, incorporating positive and critical insights.", "length": 3326}

{"prompt": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n Stress and Back Pain\n From Chris\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing and Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: Doctors tend to dismiss him but a lot of his patients think he\u2019s terrific. Jeremy takes a middle ground. He thinks that perhaps 10 percent of back pain has primarily emotional roots and the rest is physical. In addition, psychological elements can aggravate physical pain significantly. But 10 percent is worth a word here. More than a word, actually. Jeremy and I do not presume to give psychiatric advice\u2014or advice about stress, which is mostly what\u2019s involved\u2014but we include this brief chapter just to alert you to the possibility that your back pain may have its roots in stress or it may be worsened by stress or other largely psychological issues. \nI confess that a couple of years ago I would have been even more skeptical than I am today about stress and, by extension, about the connection between stress and back pain. But there has been a lot of talk lately about stress being the great scourge of American life, especially corporate life, and the importance of \u201cmindfulness\u201d; there seems to be broad agreement that both are real and important. Some corporations are spending serious time trying to help their people learn mindfulness. Like others of my generation, I used to think that talk about stress (I\u2019d never heard of mindfulness) was something made up in California by out-of-work yoga teachers, and I said the hell with it. That, it turns out, was a deeply uninformed view. Stress, I have lately learned, is very real indeed. And it probably can raise hell with your back, all by itself. Jeremy\u2019s estimate that some 10 percent of back pain is caused by stress is probably pretty good. \nStress is a fundamental part of our emotional wiring, and it runs deep. I\u2019m going to use a little technical language here to make me sound smarter than I am. A lot of the emotional stress we face is handled by our \u201cautonomic nervous system.\u201d How do you like that! Two branches of the autonomic nervous system have a lot to do with running emotions and related body changes. The first is the sympathetic branch, which basically speeds things up when life gets hairy. The other one is the parasympathetic branch, which basically slows things down, especially after a fight-or-flight event has made you crazy. \nThe parasympathetic system is for everyday use, when things are more or less okay. It handles routine stress in a routine way, and does not make you sick or crazy. The sympathetic system is supposed to be triggered only when things get seriously scary (we are talking about the sudden appearance of lions, say, or robbers with guns)\u2014extreme situations in which it makes sense to go crazy. If there really is a lion looming in the deep grass, you\u2019ve got to get out of there ASAP, so all the stress you can muster makes perfect sense. Same deal on the streets of the city when a thief with a knife appears out of the shadows and asks if you would be good enough to give him your wallet. Or your wife. Again, legitimate stress. \nYour body does an amazing thing in those fight-or-flight situations. Everything is instantly rewired to give you the best shot at either fighting back or getting away. One big change is in the blood\u2014of which there is not enough to be everywhere at once. It is shifted from peacetime distribution to a wartime footing. It is drained out of your digestive system, for example, and redirected to your extremities: legs to run for your life, or arms and shoulders and hands to grapple with the beast. And it goes to the parts of your brain and nervous system that deal with emergencies. At the same time, your heart cranks up to deliver four or five times as much blood to your body. The hair on your body \u201cstands up\u201d so it is better able to sense movement in the air (wow!). Your eyes dilate and your hearing becomes more acute. The nutrient absorption system is shut down, as are many other systems that have to do with routine maintenance. (Chronic, nonstop stress, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, is a horror for a couple of reasons. First, you cannot be responding to those extreme conditions all the time: That would be like a muscle spasm\u2014it starts to hurt. Second, all those routine but deeply important processes get shortchanged, and you go to hell for lack of maintenance. So . . . chronic stress is super-bad.)\nWhen the threat passes (and if you survive), the parasympathetic system takes over and order is restored. The hair on your neck settles down, the regular allocation of blood returns, and so on. And it works like a charm for zebras and elands and such. For us, alas, not so good. As Robert M. Sapolsky tells us in Why Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers, the zebra can be running furiously for its life one minute, and calmly cropping grass the next. Zebras are blessed with forgetfulness. Not us. We are blessed\u2014and cursed\u2014with the ability to contemplate and prepare for future emergencies and to hold on to and learn from past ones. We are not designed to let go. Eventually we do let go, but it takes us longer. So we have more stress than zebras. \nWe have another flaw in the way our fight-or-flight mechanism works. It is not just the lion or the guy with the knife that sets off our system; it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Like competition in the workplace. Like fear of our boss. Like rejection or demotion for failure to achieve this or that. Which may not sound bad but it really is. Because we take that kind of stress just as seriously as we do the lion-in-the-grass type of stress. And the problem is that that kind of stress is being triggered almost constantly, in our aptly named \u201chigh stress\u201d workplaces and society. Which leads to chronic stress. \nIntermittent stress\u2014the kind that is triggered when the lion jumps out at you\u2014is useful. Chronic stress is a curse. Not a complete curse; it does enable \u201cadvanced\u201d cultures like ours to focus much harder and much, much longer than humans used to do on what we want to achieve. We run our mighty engines at near-redline levels all the time and, sure enough, we tear around like crazy . . . achieving great things. Which is nice. And we pat ourselves on the back for doing it. (And view the French, say, with contempt because they are not as nutty as we are.) We more than pat ourselves on the back; we give each other fat salaries and tremendous recognition. Being able to function at \u201credline\u201d or sympathetic nervous system levels almost all the time is richly rewarded in this country. Which is fine except for one thing: It is eating us alive. The dislocation of circulation from core to extremities, the hyper-use of the signaling system, all the profound changes that are set in motion when the lion looms short change other areas, including, interestingly enough, our lower backs. And that dislocation can cause random short circuits, muscle spasms, and weird torques to the back. And they hurt. Quite a lot. It is not the principal source of back pain, but, for those who suffer from it, it is deadly serious and is entitled to serious treatment.\nHow do you know if you are part of the minority for whom stress is a serious cause of back pain? Hard to say but basically it\u2019s just like what Jeremy says about back pain generally: Pay attention to the pain. Focus on the behaviors that seem to precede or go with back pain. And cut them out. If back pain is correlated with stressful situations, think about it. Maybe get yourself out of that mess. Or study one of the thousands of books about \u201cstress management\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of material out there on mindfulness, and it is helpful. \nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy, Anyone?\nOkay, here\u2019s my own little stress story, the one that made me seriously open to the idea of stress as a serious thing. \nI was recently in the midst of a ton of heavy, work-related stuff, and we had just flown out to Aspen for a series of work meetings and such (there would be a little skiing but not much). We were starting two new businesses and neither was easy. Hilary and I got to the friend\u2019s house where we were staying late at night. But the real thing was that I had learned earlier that day that my beloved coauthor and friend, Harry Lodge, was going to die of cancer in the next few days. The whole business was the very definition of stress\u2014a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d you could say. \nThe morning after our late-night arrival, I was unpacking when I had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d in my chest. Long story short, I told Hilary I felt weird, we called the local hospital, and soon I was on a gurney in a big ambulance being rushed to the emergency room. I was met by an absolutely terrific heart doc, a mild-mannered guy with a serious national reputation, even though he mostly practiced in a medium-size Colorado town. Lucky me. He said I was having a heart attack, and he was going to run a camera up my femoral artery (in my leg) to take some movies of my heart and put in stents to open the presumably clogged arteries . . . all the stuff I needed to, you know, stay alive. \nRats! I have always been proud as a peacock of my great heart and aerobic strength; now this! Good grief. \nBut it turns out it was not that bad. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says, after I come out of the anesthesia. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this every day, but you did not have a heart attack. A heart attack is a failure of the heart, caused by a blockage of blood vessels that feed the heart. In a surprisingly short time, the part of the heart that is not getting fed\u2014or the whole organ\u2014dies. That is a heart attack and, mercifully, you did not have that. In fact, your heart and the vessels that feed it are in amazing shape: You will never have a heart attack.\u201d Oh. I took that pretty well, but I was curious, too. If I\u2019m not having a heart attack, why are we here? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says again. \u201cI have only seen it a few times, but you have a classic case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . . . a temporary (and sometimes fatal) weakness of the heart itself, caused by stress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cExtremely lucky man. You have what is sometimes called \u2018the widow\u2019s broken heart,\u2019 common among recently bereaved spouses. Almost certainly brought on, in your case, by general stress and by concern for your gravely ill friend. [He had interviewed me briefly before the procedure.] Sometimes it is fatal, but not for you. And, if it\u2019s not fatal, it simply goes away.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t begin to get it. I press for more information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the videotape,\u201d he says. He wheels over this big gadget and, in a second, I am looking at a movie of my own beating heart. Yowee! A very rare treat. None of the many tests for heart problems goes inside and takes movies; it\u2019s too dangerous. But this was not a test, and here we are. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d he says, and points to what he says are the amazingly clear (unblocked) and peppy arteries all around my heart. And the strength of the muscles. Rare, he says, especially for an old chap like me. Then he drops the bomb. \n\u201cHere is where the stress hit you,\u201d he says, and points to the lower one-eighth of my thumping heart. \u201cYour other heart walls are vigorous and fine, pumping lots of blood. This area, they are not. Also, you have some fibrillation, irregular beats.\u201d He points. The difference is unmistakable. For a long time we both stare at my beating heart, see the weakness and the arrhythmia. \u201cThis will go away on its own in a while,\u201d he says. And repeats how very lucky I am. Huh.\nWhat\u2019s the point of the story? It\u2019s simple: Stress is real. You can see it in a movie of your heart. It can have a very real impact on your body. It literally weakens you and leaves you prone to all kinds of things. You can see stress happening on some occasions. And\u2014maybe\u2014there are things you can do about it. I received several serious lectures from doctors during my \u201cwidow\u2019s heart attack\u201d phase, all urging me to remember that I was in my eighties and to, for heaven\u2019s sake, cut back some on my routine. Which I did. It\u2019s an interesting compromise between staying as alive and fully committed as possible. I\u2019m still feeling my way. We\u2019ll see. \nWhat about you? All we can say is, watch yourself. By which we mean, keep an eye on your own situation and bear in mind the possibility that your back pain may be stress related. Then our advice is to quit your job, get a bowl of rice, and sit on the sidewalk. Or go live with your parents. Some damn thing, I don\u2019t know. Stress is hard. But it is not imaginary. Read up on it. Do something. \nActually, we have some better advice than that. There are a lot of well-trained people\u2014including our friend Sarah Stuart, who has done retreats and other work with me\u2014who have studied stress and who instruct businesspeople in particular in \u201cmindfulness,\u201d a technique that the great guru in the field, Jon Kabat Zinn, defines as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\u201d Okay. But my shallow experience with it would lead me to say it is learning to do relatively short bursts when you clear your mind of all thoughts about what\u2019s coming next (or what stupid thing", "length": 3416}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n RULE #6\n Crawl Before You Walk, Walk Before You Run\n From Jeremy\nAs you know by now, the essence of the protocol is lifelong behavioral change. That means changing the way you carry yourself and move (the neutral spine and all that). But it also means adopting and staying with our carefully designed (and progressive) exercise regimen. It is designed for back pain and it is essential for a permanent cure. And you have to do it correctly. There is an awful lot of text and a bunch of pictures about exercise in this book. But it\u2019s not because you have to do so many exercises; there really aren\u2019t that many. It\u2019s because we want you to do them right. Remember, you are far more likely to do these exercises with the compensatory patterns you have been doing for years unless you read closely and concentrate on doing them the right way. Doing them the wrong way will just make you better at doing bad things. \nOne great key to doing them right is to go slow in the learning process. Whether you\u2019re the type or not, you have to take it step-by-step. This is a healing process, and you cannot rush a healing process; it has its own rhythm and you have to follow it. Roll out these exercises slowly over time, progressing from one level to the next only when you \u201cget\u201d the level you are on and are ready to move up. \nRemember, it is these daily exercises that\u2014more than anything else\u2014are going to give most of you a significant and permanent reduction in pain and tightness. Other steps get you past the immediate pain. These steps make the change permanent. \nBe Still to Heal; Be Still to Stay Well \nOne of the main goals of changing your movement patterns is to make the \u201cbe still to heal\u201d concept (Rule #2, in Chapter 7) part of your daily life. Once you have achieved an initial fix, you don\u2019t have to be as still. But it is a great idea to learn to move with relative stillness (without moving your lumbar spine too much) all the time. \nThis is a big change for most of you, and you have to take it in steps; as I say, you have to crawl before you walk. The first step in learning to keep your lumbar spine still routinely is simply to learn to march in place, with a neutral spine. (This is the \u201ccrawl\u201d part of the process; it may seem too easy to bother with. It is not.) The goal is to learn to march in place with no lower spine movement. Then you can move on to other movements in this chapter.\nKey tip: If any of these movements hurt, take a step back to the last thing you could do without pain (marching in place, for instance). Stay with that for a few more days and then try to progress again. In theory, if you can march in place without pain, you can walk without pain and move without pain. It\u2019s just a matter of building up your core, turning on the right muscles, and learning to use those muscles to move in the right way. Whenever you have difficulty, go back to the previous step and start again. \nOkay, you\u2019ve done marching in place without moving your lower spine. Once that feels relatively simple, try doing this while walking. Things become a little murkier here because there are many factors at play. Because you are now weight-bearing, you need the support of important muscle groups like the glutes and latissimus dorsi (lats) to support your spine, in addition to the muscles we talked about in the core. If you can\u2019t do this at first without pain, follow the advice in the book for a while, and it will come once you have developed enough strength to support your spine while standing. \nWalking with Neutral Spine \nLearning to walk with a neutral spine means applying the same mechanics of your Slow March with Neutral Spine exercise to an upright, weight-bearing position. Almost everyone can improve their ability to walk without pain if they can do the slow march exercise on the ground. The distance you can walk without pain, or without significant increases in pain, will increase as you build core and gluteal strength and endurance by doing the exercises in this book. To get started on increasing your ability to walk with decreased pain, follow these directions:\nStep 1: Stand with good posture. Stand tall, shoulders back, head over your shoulders. Think of sticking your chest out and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaning forward. Tilt your pelvis back and forth (just like you did on the floor earlier), and stop where your lower back feels the most comfortable. \nStep 2: Use your core to lock your neutral spine in place. \nStep 3: Now try to walk while maintaining the position of your lower back and with the good posture you just set. It can help to put one hand on your stomach and one on your low back to feel for movement. Once you feel like you\u2019ve mastered maintaining neutral spine while walking, start to swing your arms from the shoulders, arm to opposite leg. This means if your right leg is swinging forward, your left arm should be as well. Make sure to always swing your arms from the shoulders as you walk; this helps dissipate force away from the spine. This movement takes time to master so don\u2019t get frustrated. Keep practicing. It gets easier after you have built endurance and strength in the muscles that support the spine. \nStep 4: If you sense your back is about to hurt, stop and have a seat for a few minutes and give your back a break. Then try walking a little longer. Over time, the period between these sitting breaks should increase, allowing you to walk farther without pain.\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complex movements. To make it easier (and to improve your chances of success) we are going to break those more complex movements down into pieces and then put them all together at the end. We will start with movement from the hips, a very basic move in all our lives all the time. Let\u2019s start with hip-hinging. Hip-hinging is a way to bend forward without stressing (i.e., bending) the spine. Done right, the axis of movement is in the hips, not the low back. Your low back should be in a protected neutral position with the core engaged. As you bend forward, your low back doesn\u2019t round or move. Let\u2019s look at a picture of hip-hinging and a picture of lumbar flexion (low back bending); one is good, the other is bad. This is simple stuff, but it is very hard to get over your ancient, bad habits. Hard but essential. \n\nHip-Hinge with Neutral Spine\nHere are a couple of pictures showing you the right way to hinge (on the left) and the wrong way (on the right). Notice the very slightly curved lower back in the hip-hinge picture on the left: no movement. Excellent! The pic on the right has quite a lot of spine movement; don\u2019t do that. When you first try this movement, it may feel awkward, and you may assume that you cannot reach as far forward with good posture. Not so. You\u2019ll soon realize that you can move just as far forward, using only your hips, as you did before, using your back. You don\u2019t lose anything and you avoid a ton of pain. Over time you will gain mobility. The reason is that moving with your lower back eventually causes pain and stiffness in your back. But moving from your hips will not have that result. Let\u2019s practice doing it right. \nRight Wrong\n\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Feel the two bones sticking out of the sides of your hips. These are called your greater trochanters. Picture a pole going through these two points, passing right through your pelvis. This is your imaginary axis of movement.\nStep 5: Now place one hand on your stomach and the other on your back. On your back, put your fingers on those little bones sticking out (spinous processes). You are putting your hands here to feel for any unwanted movement when you hip-hinge. \nStep 6: Without moving anything in the core (you shouldn\u2019t feel those little bones in your back moving), slowly bend forward on that imaginary axis of movement through the hip bones while sticking your buttocks out behind you a little bit. If you feel your stomach or back move, stop, reset, and try again.\n\nStep 7: Go only as far forward as you can without moving your back. For many of you, your hamstrings (back of legs) are going to be a limiting factor in your range of motion in the beginning. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t go too far. Your hamstrings will loosen up in time if you follow all of the advice in this book. \nStep 8: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your back or stomach. \nStep 9: This should not hurt your low back. If it does, reset your stance, find neutral spine, brace your core. Not hurting? Now try it again with a very small range of motion. Stay within the range of motion that doesn\u2019t hurt. Slowly increase your range of motion over time\u2014it will come. \nAdding Rotation\nNow let\u2019s get a little more complex. Let\u2019s add rotation to the bend. Hip-hinging correctly allows you to move forward and backward without pain. Now let\u2019s learn to move side to side. We are talking rotation. Again, think about moving from the hips. It\u2019s easiest to visualize proper rotation if you think about your waist. We don\u2019t want any movement at the waist. Try to picture your rib cage being locked on to your pelvis. That\u2019s what you want. Pretend that there are no joints between your ribs and pelvis, for this one. \nFull-Body Rotation\nThe chest, navel, and hips all move together. This means there is no (or very little) movement in the spine. The body rotates by moving the hips, knees, and pelvis. If the hips and pelvis stay facing forward while the rib cage moves, the movement comes from the waist, and therefore the lumbar spine. This type of movement can wear down the discs and joints in the spine over time, especially when additional load is applied (like unloading the dishwasher for instance). Just like hip-hinging, rotation done properly doesn\u2019t cause you to lose mobility and will improve athletic performance. Let\u2019s give it a try. Once again, the new movement is not that hard. But you are trying to unlearn a lifetime of moving with your spine. That is hard. \n\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Place your hands on the top of your pelvis with your fingers pointed forward. This hand position is to help you visualize movement of the pelvis as you get used to this movement. \nStep 5: Keep the knees bent and loose but the core engaged, and try to turn a little to the right by shifting the knees and hips. Your fingers, navel, hip bones, chest bone, and face should all point the same direction. It\u2019s okay if you pivot the feet a little bit. \n\nStep 6: Now try to the left.\nStep 7: Slowly increase your range of motion by bending more at the knees. \nStep 8: Then increase your range of motion even more by pivoting your feet. \nStep 9: At all times and especially at the end of the movement, your chest bone, head, navel, and hips should be in alignment. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\nKnee pain: Stay lighter on your feet\\ and pivot the ball of the inside foot (the side you are moving away from) as you rotate. \nTorso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat\nNow let\u2019s try to put those two movements\u2014the hip-hinge and the rotation\u2014together with a squat for a realistic, three-dimensional movement that allows you to accomplish everyday tasks (think unloading the dishwasher, putting up groceries) without stressing your back. You are going to rotate and bend down (hip-hinge), then come back up to the other side and extend. \nNotice that within that entire chain of movement, the person in the drawing does not really move his spine (look at the waist if you\u2019re having trouble visualizing that). The rib cage remains locked onto the pelvis the entire time. These pictures show you that you can go almost 180 degrees from side to side, stooping as low as you can and then extending as high as your hands can go, without compromising your back. Let\u2019s try it.\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in. \nStep 3: Stand with good posture. \nStep 4: Rotate torso to the right without twisting the waist as before.", "length": 3133}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER NINETEEN\n Congratulations! And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative", "length": 3251}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n RULE #6\n Crawl Before You Walk, Walk Before You Run\n From Jeremy\nAs you know by now, the essence of the protocol is lifelong behavioral change. That means changing the way you carry yourself and move (the neutral spine and all that). But it also means adopting and staying with our carefully designed (and progressive) exercise regimen. It is designed for back pain and it is essential for a permanent cure. And you have to do it correctly. There is an awful lot of text and a bunch of pictures about exercise in this book. But it\u2019s not because you have to do so many exercises; there really aren\u2019t that many. It\u2019s because we want you to do them right. Remember, you are far more likely to do these exercises with the compensatory patterns you have been doing for years unless you read closely and concentrate on doing them the right way. Doing them the wrong way will just make you better at doing bad things. \nOne great key to doing them right is to go slow in the learning process. Whether you\u2019re the type or not, you have to take it step-by-step. This is a healing process, and you cannot rush a healing process; it has its own rhythm and you have to follow it. Roll out these exercises slowly over time, progressing from one level to the next only when you \u201cget\u201d the level you are on and are ready to move up. \nRemember, it is these daily exercises that\u2014more than anything else\u2014are going to give most of you a significant and permanent reduction in pain and tightness. Other steps get you past the immediate pain. These steps make the change permanent. \nBe Still to Heal; Be Still to Stay Well \nOne of the main goals of changing your movement patterns is to make the \u201cbe still to heal\u201d concept (Rule #2, in Chapter 7) part of your daily life. Once you have achieved an initial fix, you don\u2019t have to be as still. But it is a great idea to learn to move with relative stillness (without moving your lumbar spine too much) all the time. \nThis is a big change for most of you, and you have to take it in steps; as I say, you have to crawl before you walk. The first step in learning to keep your lumbar spine still routinely is simply to learn to march in place, with a neutral spine. (This is the \u201ccrawl\u201d part of the process; it may seem too easy to bother with. It is not.) The goal is to learn to march in place with no lower spine movement. Then you can move on to other movements in this chapter.\nKey tip: If any of these movements hurt, take a step back to the last thing you could do without pain (marching in place, for instance). Stay with that for a few more days and then try to progress again. In theory, if you can march in place without pain, you can walk without pain and move without pain. It\u2019s just a matter of building up your core, turning on the right muscles, and learning to use those muscles to move in the right way. Whenever you have difficulty, go back to the previous step and start again. \nOkay, you\u2019ve done marching in place without moving your lower spine. Once that feels relatively simple, try doing this while walking. Things become a little murkier here because there are many factors at play. Because you are now weight-bearing, you need the support of important muscle groups like the glutes and latissimus dorsi (lats) to support your spine, in addition to the muscles we talked about in the core. If you can\u2019t do this at first without pain, follow the advice in the book for a while, and it will come once you have developed enough strength to support your spine while standing. \nWalking with Neutral Spine \nLearning to walk with a neutral spine means applying the same mechanics of your Slow March with Neutral Spine exercise to an upright, weight-bearing position. Almost everyone can improve their ability to walk without pain if they can do the slow march exercise on the ground. The distance you can walk without pain, or without significant increases in pain, will increase as you build core and gluteal strength and endurance by doing the exercises in this book. To get started on increasing your ability to walk with decreased pain, follow these directions:\nStep 1: Stand with good posture. Stand tall, shoulders back, head over your shoulders. Think of sticking your chest out and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaning forward. Tilt your pelvis back and forth (just like you did on the floor earlier), and stop where your lower back feels the most comfortable. \nStep 2: Use your core to lock your neutral spine in place. \nStep 3: Now try to walk while maintaining the position of your lower back and with the good posture you just set. It can help to put one hand on your stomach and one on your low back to feel for movement. Once you feel like you\u2019ve mastered maintaining neutral spine while walking, start to swing your arms from the shoulders, arm to opposite leg. This means if your right leg is swinging forward, your left arm should be as well. Make sure to always swing your arms from the shoulders as you walk; this helps dissipate force away from the spine. This movement takes time to master so don\u2019t get frustrated. Keep practicing. It gets easier after you have built endurance and strength in the muscles that support the spine. \nStep 4: If you sense your back is about to hurt, stop and have a seat for a few minutes and give your back a break. Then try walking a little longer. Over time, the period between these sitting breaks should increase, allowing you to walk farther without pain.\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complex movements. To make it easier (and to improve your chances of success) we are going to break those more complex movements down into pieces and then put them all together at the end. We will start with movement from the hips, a very basic move in all our lives all the time. Let\u2019s start with hip-hinging. Hip-hinging is a way to bend forward without stressing (i.e., bending) the spine. Done right, the axis of movement is in the hips, not the low back. Your low back should be in a protected neutral position with the core engaged. As you bend forward, your low back doesn\u2019t round or move. Let\u2019s look at a picture of hip-hinging and a picture of lumbar flexion (low back bending); one is good, the other is bad. This is simple stuff, but it is very hard to get over your ancient, bad habits. Hard but essential. \n\nHip-Hinge with Neutral Spine\nHere are a couple of pictures showing you the right way to hinge (on the left) and the wrong way (on the right). Notice the very slightly curved lower back in the hip-hinge picture on the left: no movement. Excellent! The pic on the right has quite a lot of spine movement; don\u2019t do that. When you first try this movement, it may feel awkward, and you may assume that you cannot reach as far forward with good posture. Not so. You\u2019ll soon realize that you can move just as far forward, using only your hips, as you did before, using your back. You don\u2019t lose anything and you avoid a ton of pain. Over time you will gain mobility. The reason is that moving with your lower back eventually causes pain and stiffness in your back. But moving from your hips will not have that result. Let\u2019s practice doing it right. \nRight Wrong\n\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Feel the two bones sticking out of the sides of your hips. These are called your greater trochanters. Picture a pole going through these two points, passing right through your pelvis. This is your imaginary axis of movement.\nStep 5: Now place one hand on your stomach and the other on your back. On your back, put your fingers on those little bones sticking out (spinous processes). You are putting your hands here to feel for any unwanted movement when you hip-hinge. \nStep 6: Without moving anything in the core (you shouldn\u2019t feel those little bones in your back moving), slowly bend forward on that imaginary axis of movement through the hip bones while sticking your buttocks out behind you a little bit. If you feel your stomach or back move, stop, reset, and try again.\n\nStep 7: Go only as far forward as you can without moving your back. For many of you, your hamstrings (back of legs) are going to be a limiting factor in your range of motion in the beginning. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t go too far. Your hamstrings will loosen up in time if you follow all of the advice in this book. \nStep 8: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your back or stomach. \nStep 9: This should not hurt your low back. If it does, reset your stance, find neutral spine, brace your core. Not hurting? Now try it again with a very small range of motion. Stay within the range of motion that doesn\u2019t hurt. Slowly increase your range of motion over time\u2014it will come. \nAdding Rotation\nNow let\u2019s get a little more complex. Let\u2019s add rotation to the bend. Hip-hinging correctly allows you to move forward and backward without pain. Now let\u2019s learn to move side to side. We are talking rotation. Again, think about moving from the hips. It\u2019s easiest to visualize proper rotation if you think about your waist. We don\u2019t want any movement at the waist. Try to picture your rib cage being locked on to your pelvis. That\u2019s what you want. Pretend that there are no joints between your ribs and pelvis, for this one. \nFull-Body Rotation\nThe chest, navel, and hips all move together. This means there is no (or very little) movement in the spine. The body rotates by moving the hips, knees, and pelvis. If the hips and pelvis stay facing forward while the rib cage moves, the movement comes from the waist, and therefore the lumbar spine. This type of movement can wear down the discs and joints in the spine over time, especially when additional load is applied (like unloading the dishwasher for instance). Just like hip-hinging, rotation done properly doesn\u2019t cause you to lose mobility and will improve athletic performance. Let\u2019s give it a try. Once again, the new movement is not that hard. But you are trying to unlearn a lifetime of moving with your spine. That is hard. \n\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Place your hands on the top of your pelvis with your fingers pointed forward. This hand position is to help you visualize movement of the pelvis as you get used to this movement. \nStep 5: Keep the knees bent and loose but the core engaged, and try to turn a little to the right by shifting the knees and hips. Your fingers, navel, hip bones, chest bone, and face should all point the same direction. It\u2019s okay if you pivot the feet a little bit. \n\nStep 6: Now try to the left.\nStep 7: Slowly increase your range of motion by bending more at the knees. \nStep 8: Then increase your range of motion even more by pivoting your feet. \nStep 9: At all times and especially at the end of the movement, your chest bone, head, navel, and hips should be in alignment. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\nKnee pain: Stay lighter on your feet\\ and pivot the ball of the inside foot (the side you are moving away from) as you rotate. \nTorso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat\nNow let\u2019s try to put those two movements\u2014the hip-hinge and the rotation\u2014together with a squat for a realistic, three-dimensional movement that allows you to accomplish everyday tasks (think unloading the dishwasher, putting up groceries) without stressing your back. You are going to rotate and bend down (hip-hinge), then come back up to the other side and extend. \nNotice that within that entire chain of movement, the person in the drawing does not really move his spine (look at the waist if you\u2019re having trouble visualizing that). The rib cage remains locked onto the pelvis the entire time. These pictures show you that you can go almost 180 degrees from side to side, stooping as low as you can and then extending as high as your hands can go, without compromising your back. Let\u2019s try it.\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in. \nStep 3: Stand with good posture. \nStep 4: Rotate torso to the right without twisting the waist as before.\n\nStep 5: Pivot the inside foot (left foot, in this case) as you turn.\nStep 6: After initiating the rotation, start to hinge at the hips, bending forward. Remember not to round your back. \n\nStep 7: Go only as low and as far to the right as you can without twisting at the waist or rounding your low back. You will now be in a squat/split squat position.\n\nStep 8: Reach out with your arms as if you were picking something up off of the floor. \n\nStep 9: Bring the arms back in and re-center your weight over your buttocks and feet. \nStep 10: Using your glutes, lift yourself out of the lowered position, pushing with your right glutes as you rotate back to midline while hinging back up through the hips. \n\nStep 11: As you swing past midline (without twisting at the waist!), pivot your right foot, continuing to use the right glutes, and extend your arms up toward the ceiling as if you were putting something on a shelf. \nStep 12: Return to the starting position without twisting at the waist. Try this in front of a mirror several times. \nStep 13: Then try this movement on the opposite side of your body. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Knee pain: If your knees hurt as you start to rotate the torso, be lighter on your feet. Allow the feet to pivot a little bit. If the knees hurt when you are hinged forward at the bottom of the movement, drop your buttocks back more so that you are in a squat position (think of a baseball catcher) and lessen your range of motion. Try doing small movements and increase your range of motion gradually.\n\u2022 Back pain: If your back hurts with this one, it is likely you are twisting at the waist, rounding the back, or don\u2019t have the gluteal strength yet to perform this movement to its full range of motion. Do a little investigating: Can you hip-hinge without pain? If so, that\u2019s not the issue. Can you do the torso rotation without pain? Can you squat without pain? If you can do all three without pain then it is likely you are having difficulty putting all of these moves together without sacrificing form on one of them. Try doing this movement in very small pieces in front of a mirror or loved one, and gradually increase your range of motion over time. If any one piece causes pain, work on that one until you can do it pain-free, and then come back and try this movement again. \nRemember, these movements must become habits. That sounds daunting but it really isn\u2019t that hard. Once your back starts to feel better, it will let you know when you move the wrong way and you\u2019ll avoid that at all costs.", "length": 3788}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER NINETEEN\n Congratulations! And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative", "length": 3251}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER ONE\n The Promise\n From Chris\nBack pain is the monster in most of our lives. The ogre under the bed. The ogre that lands you in bed all too often. Or on the floor . . . flopping around in pain. Like a sunfish on a hot cement dock. \nMost Americans know that pain well. Know the agony, the sudden sickening return after it\u2019s been gone for a while. The canceling of plans, the loss of a job. Everything. They cannot live with it\u2014not really live\u2014and they would do anything for relief. But there is no relief. They\u2019ve tried everything, and nothing works. Nothing meaningful, anyway. Back pain sufferers spend an average of $2,500 a year for palliative \u201cfixes,\u201d but they get precious little in return. They\u2019d spend more\u2014they\u2019d spend anything\u2014if the fixes really worked. But most don\u2019t. Or not very well. Or not for long. People structure their lives around the pain as best they can, but that doesn\u2019t work either, because you never know when it\u2019s going to hit. \nAnd when it comes, it\u2019s not like a sore shoulder or a bum leg; you can\u2019t use the other arm instead. You can\u2019t limp along with a cane, relying on the good leg. When your back is the problem, everything goes, and you\u2019re cooked. When your back hurts, your life hurts. And you can\u2019t do a damned thing. \nTHE PROMISE\nThat is about to end. You are going to have trouble believing that sentence, but it\u2019s true. That pain is about to go away or be sharply reduced. And the change is going to be permanent. For about 80 percent of you, anyway. That\u2019s an astonishing promise, and it\u2019s absolutely true. We know of nothing else in the field that comes close. \n\u201cSuccess\u201d means either the permanent elimination of pain (the result for most of you) or a reduction of its severity from the 7\u201310 level\u2014on a scale of 1\u201310 (that\u2019s agony)\u2014to the 1\u20133 level (that\u2019s a nuisance). Blessed, blessed relief, either way. As I say, it is only going to work for about 80 percent of you, but that\u2019s a near-miracle. And Jeremy has solid suggestions for the rest of you, too. (See Chapter 4 to learn if you\u2019re in the 20 percent and find out what to do.) But remember the main point: For 80 percent of you, the pain stops here.\nWe hope that the \u201cyou\u201d in that sentence is an enormous number of people. Jeremy is a modest man but he knows what he can do\u2014what he has done\u2014and he is ambitious about taking his protocol to a much broader audience. Indeed, he wants to start a revolution in back pain care in America, starting with you, and he wants it to be universal and cheap. He thinks\u2014he and I think\u2014that it can be done in a book. That sounds wild\u2014that this horrendous problem can be fixed with such a modest tool. But it\u2019s not. Because back pain is all about behavior, and you can deal with behavior in a book. As you will learn in a moment, the vast majority of you created your back pain with your own, long-term behavior. And only you can fix it, with profound changes in that behavior. It is a matter of showing you what you did before that made a mess of your back, and teaching you what you have to do now. And then you doing it. Jeremy explains, and he shows you how. You do the work. You will succeed. A surprise, perhaps one you will have trouble getting your head around at first. But it\u2019s true: You will succeed. \nSo how bad is the problem? Pretty bad, as most of you know. Four out of five of us have back pain so bad we seek help from health care professionals. The nation as a whole spends $100 billion on the problem. It does more to disrupt business than anything else. And, of course, it raises hell with millions of lives. For some, it is a recurring nuisance, something that takes the joy out of the day, the week, the month. For more of us, it is an intermittent horror, with the pain at the agony level and we just can\u2019t move. Your wife calls your host for dinner: \u201cBill is flat on his back on the floor. We may have to go to the hospital. Sorry.\u201d You can\u2019t go out to dinner; you can\u2019t perform your duties. Hell, you can\u2019t get off the floor! It ruins careers, messes up companies, trashes marriages, and raises holy hell with just about everything else. For most, it comes and goes, but when it comes . . . it\u2019s just god-awful. Oh lord! What do you do?\nNot much, until now. There\u2019s conventional medicine\u2014which is such a blessing in so many areas of our lives\u2014but it is apt not to be great for back pain. For extreme cases (the 20 percent we mentioned), there is surgery, and for them it may be the only option; Jeremy will alert those who should be thinking about it. But surgery\u2014tremendously important and successful for some\u2014is not the answer for most of you. It is well known, for example, that at least one popular operation\u2014spinal fusion\u2014is one of the most overprescribed operations in the country. It is a serious operation (it costs about $100,000), it is often unnecessary, and it often doesn\u2019t work. Not for long, anyway, and sometimes not at all. That is scary. Jeremy, and the best surgeons, all say that surgery should be a last resort. There are other \u201cmedical\u201d steps, like cortisone or other shots, but, once again, relief is temporary, there can be serious side effects, and there are limits to how often you can go there. The basic problem with traditional medicine and back pain is that they are not a very good fit. Western medicine is not heavily focused on behavioral problems and behavioral change; it simply did not grow up that way. And back pain is primarily a behavioral problem. Which means that, ultimately, only you can fix it. \nDon\u2019t worry if this concept doesn\u2019t quite sink in at the first reading. It\u2019s what the whole book is about. We\u2019ll get there. Together. \nA Younger Next Year Book\nI say \u201cwe\u2019ll get there together,\u201d and that\u2019s an important part of the book and the cure. This is \u201ca Younger Next Year\u201d book. That means several things, as some of you know. First, it means there is a presentation by two writers, a deadly serious professional scientist (that\u2019s Jeremy for this book . . . it was Harry Lodge in the first Younger Next Year books) and a layman (me). As I used to say of Harry and as I now say of Jeremy: \u201cHe\u2019s young and smart, and I\u2019m old and funny.\u201d The pairing is supposed to make the book easier to follow (and maybe just a teeny bit fun to read) without losing a whisper of scientific integrity. The scientist is in charge throughout, but reading the book should not make your teeth hurt. Not hurt badly, anyway.\nIt also means that the core idea is that behavioral change can have a profound effect on your wellness and quality of life. Far more of an effect, in important areas, than the best conventional medicine. The \u201cmodest\u201d boast in the original Younger Next Year book was that behavioral change could put off 70 percent of aging until close to the end of life, and eliminate 50 percent of the most serious diseases completely. Which was absolutely true; no one has ever disagreed. Over 2 million people bought Younger Next Year (in twenty-three languages) and made it a cult book for those over forty, many thousands of whom profoundly changed their lives. A huge number of people have come up to me and Harry over the years to say, \u201cHey, man, thanks for writing that book; it changed my life.\u201d Nice.\nThe Younger Next Year Back Book is a little more specific: Behavioral change\u2014spelled out by Jeremy\u2014can end or radically reduce back pain. But the consequences for back pain sufferers are every bit as important. I was with Jeremy recently when a guy in his fifties said to me that he\u2019d come to Jeremy the previous summer, after a lifetime of serious back pain: \u201cI could not bend over to lace my own shoes. I\u2019d been in agony for decades. And Jeremy simply fixed it. Jeremy gave me my life back.\u201d Jeremy has a thousand stories like that. More than a thousand. We hope to have a million before we\u2019re done.\nFinally, it means that the book has a certain integrity. Harry and I went to great lengths to make Younger Next Year solid\u2014conservative, if anything. To the best of our knowledge, there was not a single exaggeration, and certainly not a single misstatement. Jeremy and I have done the same here. Dealing with back pain is an evolving field, and some things we say may turn out to be wrong as people learn more. But not the basic lines and not the major claims. The book is as solid as we can make it, and it will stand up. As Younger Next Year has done, strikingly. \nJeremy came to me with the idea for doing this book together because he thought YNY and his story had \u201cthe same genes.\u201d Which was quite right. Beyond that, Jeremy is a \u201cgood guy\u201d; he wants to do good in this world, and the fact that back pain makes such a mess of so many lives\u2014unnecessarily in his view\u2014makes him crazy. He knew how successful the Younger Next Year books had been, he knew me, and he thought that maybe the two of us could pair up and get the word out . . . change the world of back pain.\nSo that\u2019s our modest goal here\u2014first Jeremy\u2019s and now mine: We just want to, you know, change the world. And eliminate back pain for millions. Hey, couldn\u2019t hurt. Along the way we hope to make a couple of billion dollars ourselves but Jeremy\u2019s great motivation is to change the world of back pain. Pretty good guy, Jeremy. \nNow, let\u2019s have a quiet word about some things this book won\u2019t do. It won\u2019t do any good if you just stick it under your pillow, for example. You have to read it. Closely. We\u2019ll make that as easy as we can but it ain\u2019t always going to be a walk on the beach. Then, by heaven, you have to go to work yourself on the cure. You have to do the initial fixes yourself. And then you have to adopt Jeremy\u2019s carefully tailored exercise regimen to make the cure permanent, and that\u2019s not always easy. Well, it\u2019s easy if you know how, and we work like crazy to show you how in the book (and in videos we\u2019ll refer to in a minute). \nFinally, you have to know\u2014as I said before\u2014that the book may not work for some of you. You\u2019re too far gone. Awfully damn sorry about that but about 20 percent of you\u2014Jeremy estimates, conservatively\u2014are going to have progressed to a stage where you are probably going to need traditional medical help, possibly including surgery. He\u2019ll tell you how to know if that means you. And a few more of you\u2014with back pain that is rooted primarily in muscle \u201ctrigger points\u201d (there\u2019s a terrific chapter on that)\u2014may need to turn to a chiropractor or physical therapist, at least briefly, to show you how to find and release muscle spasms. Then you come back to the book to lock in the change and make it permanent. But the basic claim\u2014that some 80 percent of you can get complete or significant pain relief permanently\u2014is solid. \nI asked Jeremy, early on, if he could back up that number by going through his records. He said he could not. (Oh, lord!) But, he said, he could remember every single one of the handful of patients he thought he could help who in fact he could not (excluding the ones he sent on for conventional medical help). He could count them on his fingers. I thought that was good enough. So, that 80 percent claim is not just solid, it is conservative.\nBasic Insight: You Got Yourself into This Mess, and Only You Can Get Yourself Out \nJeremy\u2019s success has been based on two great insights. The first was to realize (along with a handful of others, including Bill Fabrocini, who wrote the Introduction) that your own long-term behavior (how you carry yourself, your posture, and certain repetitive movements) is almost always the cause of your back pain. Sometimes it\u2019s trauma or a weird event but not often. And only changing behavior is going to effect a permanent cure. In other words, it\u2019s going to be up to you in the end. Jeremy will point the way and tell you exactly what to do: first to effect the cure and then to do maintenance. But you do the hard work. And\u2014as in the other Younger Next Year books\u2014exercise is going to be at the heart of it. Steady, whole-body exercise for the rest of your life. If you\u2019re new to all this, that may sound alarming\u2014steady exercise forever\u2014but it\u2019s not. In this, as in other things, exercise is going to turn out to be the key to the good life. \nThe second great insight was to realize that, while back pain seems local and specific, it is almost always a whole-body or at least whole-core problem in the end (we\u2019ll tell you all about the core in a bit). And a whole-body approach is indispensable to its cure. Drawing on those two insights, on his review of the available science, and on his own vast, clinical experience (he has been doing nothing but treating back pain his whole adult life), Jeremy has developed a technique that has had unprecedented success. \nYou are probably a bit of a student of back pain yourself if you\u2019ve had it for a while, but you are about to learn some new things. You will learn, for example, that back pain is not a \u201cdisease,\u201d as some doctors say. Nor, in most cases, is it the result of an accident or trauma. Or bad genes or bad luck. Or (mostly) psychological issues. Sometimes, but mostly not. And it is not from rolling over \u201cfunny\u201d in the night or picking up something heavy, carelessly. Or making love in some goofy and disgusting way. It\u2019s not the malfunction of a particular disc", "length": 3383}

{"prompt": "Hi I have a draft press for Jean-Michel Blais' new album here: \n\n\\*\\*UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL XX\\*\\*\nMERCURY KX ANNOUNCES JEAN-MICHEL BLAIS' NEW EP \"SERENADES\"\nMontreal-based post-classical pianist and composer Jean-Michel Blais is pleased to announce his new EP \u201cSerenades\u201d, out March 10th on Mercury KX. The EP is the solo piano companion to Blais\u2019 highly successful and loved album \u201cAubades\u201d, released this past February.\n\u201cSerenades\u201d is the nocturnal companion to the brightness of \u201cAubades\u201d, and features intimate and atmospheric solo piano versions of key tracks from the album, including \u201cAmour\u201d, \u201cOuessant\u201d, and \u201cMurmures\u201d. It also features three new tracks: \u201c117 (Bach)\u201d, \u201cLa Chute\u201d, and \u201cMorning (Improv)\u201d. \u201cLa Chute\u201d (\u201cThe Fall\u201d) was especially composed for the left hand, due to a right arm injury Blais suffered after falling on ice before a performance. This inspired him to write this piece particularly for the left hand. The first single \u201cOuessant\u201d (Piano) is a melancholic slow wander through luminous and soothing solo piano soundscapes.\n\u201cSerenades\u201d is a testament to Blais\u2019 musical prowess and ability to create captivating and moving musical landscapes. It\u2019s sure to be a stunning addition to Blais\u2019 already impressive discography.\n\n---\n\nI have written it based on the following information:\n\nJEAN-MICHEL BLAIS DECCA BIO:\nJean-Michel Blais - Biography\n \nJean-Michel Blais is a post-classical pianist and composer living in Montreal, Canada.\n \nBlais grew up in a rural French Catholic town in Quebec and began tinkering on his family's organ at age 9. By 11, he began writing original compositions and taking piano lessons. A natural talent, by 17 he was invited to the Trois-Rivieres Music Conservatory and began training as a classical pianist. The constraints of formal training began to wear on Blais who started to gravitate towards experimentation and improvisation. He eventually left the school and put aside his musical path.\n \nIn his mid-20s, Blais traveled to Europe and Latin America, studied special education, liberal arts and psychology, while moving to Berlin for about a year and six months in Buenos Aires, before settling in Montreal where he rediscovered his love for composing and performing, which caught the ear of Toronto-based indie label Arts & Crafts.\n \nBlais\u2019 debut album, Il, was written and recorded in his apartment over two years of daily improvisations. It was released on April 8, 2016, and amassed over 50 million streams worldwide, reaching #1 on Billboard\u2019s Classical chart in Canada 14 times, earning a Polaris Music Prize long list nomination and a spot on Time Magazine\u2019s Top ten albums of 2016.\n \nThe following year, Blais performed at the prestigious Red Bull Music Academy in collaboration with Grammy-nominated producer CFCF. This spurred a partnership between the two musicians that yielded Cascades, a collaborative EP released on March 15, 2017. The release earned praises for its brave interplay between piano and electronics, including by the likes of Pitchfork and BBC Radio 6.\n \nAfter a year of touring North America and Europe, Blais began working on his sophomore album, Dans ma main. Released on May 11, 2018. Jean-Michel Blais\u2019 Dans ma main is an expansive album of post-classical piano music with strands of electronic detail. Recorded at night in a Steinway & Sons piano shop, Blais blends his classical skill and precise pop sensibility with synthetic accompaniment, which creates unique environments where the piano\u2019s intimacy can be subtly disrupted at any time. Dans ma main earned a Polaris Music Prize short list nomination.\n \nFascinated with the cathartic response of worldwide audiences to his pin-drop performances, Blais considers how music has served as a tool of wellness in his own life: from his early career in special education, to his parents\u2019 use of ambient music to soothe the Tourettic symptoms he\u2019s been suffering from since childhood. On Dans ma main, Jean-Michel calls upon these periods of his life, reimagining a serenity that he previously found only seated at a piano.\n \nIn the spring of 2018, when asked by his landlord to leave his beloved apartment where he recorded his debut album Il, Blais invited friends and family in his bedroom to take part into an intimate series of home concert and recording sessions, which gave birth to his sophomore EP, Eviction sessions, released on Novembre 18, 2018.\n---\nTIMELINE FOR \u201cSERENADES\u201d:\n(8 July - amour (piano) - out already)\n18 Nov: ouessant (piano) - Single 2 (no EP announcement)\n20-29 Jan: Concerts in Toronto, NYC & Quebec - should EP be announced by the 20th?\n3 Feb: EP announcement & la chute (Single 3)\n10 Mar: serenades EP release + yanni (piano) - focus track\n---\n \n \nTRACKLIST FOR \u201cSERENADES\u201d:\n117 (bach)\namour (piano)\nla chute\nmorning (improv)\nfl\u00e2neur (piano)\nyanni (piano)\nouessant (piano)\nmurmures (piano)\n---\n \n---\n \n---\nJEAN-MICHEL BLAIS PREVIOUS ALBUM \u201caubades\u201d:\naubades, the new album from post-classical piano icon Jean-Michel Blais, marks the Montreal-born musician\u2019s transition from pianist to composer, as he writes for an ensemble for the first time in his career. Written during the pandemic and following a breakup, Blais has used his distinctive musical voice to create a defiantly uplifting record with glistening instrumental textures and warm major tonalities. The album\u2019s title refers to the \u201caubade\u201d, a Middle Ages morning love song about lovers separating at daybreak, a dawn serenade.\n \nDespite the difficult global and personal backdrop, Blais described the time writing this album as a \u201cfruitful moment of creativity for me. We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.\u201d Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass string.\n---\nBACKGROUND ARTICLE (ON CLASSIC FM SITE) ON THE HISTORY OF PIECES FOR LEFT HAND PIANO\n \nThe best classical music for piano left hand\n12 August 2014, 12:56 | Updated: 6 January 2017, 14:45\n \nFacebook share Twitter share\nIn celebration of International Left Handers Day, we're investigating the top ten pieces of piano music composed specifically for the left hand, as chosen by one-handed piano virtuoso, Nicholas McCarthy.\n \n1. Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\n \nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\n \n \n \n \n \n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\n \nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Sa\u00ebns' left hand \u00e9tudes religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\n \n \n \n \n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\n \nADVERTISING\n \nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\n \n \n \n \n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\n \nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's \u00e9tudes - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate \u00e9tudes to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire \u00e9tude for left hand solo.\n \n \n \n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\n \nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\n \n \n \n \n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\n \nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\n \n \n \n \n7. Diversions - Britten\n \nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\n \n \n \n \n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\n \nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\n \n \n \n9. Six \u00e9tudes for the left hand - Saint-Sa\u00ebns\n \nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Sa\u00ebns' piano \u00e9tudes are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\n \n \n \n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\n \nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano.\n---\nKEY INFO ON THE NEW ALBUM:\n \nKEY INFO\n \nnew single ouessant (piano) is a melancholic slow wander through luminous and soothing solo piano soundscapes\nannouncing 10 Jan: s\u00e9r\u00e9nades is the solo piano companion EP to the highly-successful and loved album aubades (album of vibrant, sweeping works for chamber ensemble released this past February 2022)\ns\u00e9r\u00e9nades is the nocturnal companion to the brightness of aubades\ninspired by Franz Liszt\u2019s solo piano reductions\nfeatures intimate & atmospheric solo piano versions of key tracks from aubades - amour, ouessant, murmures\nfeatures three new tracks - 117 (bach), la chute, morning (improv)\nla chute (\u2018the fall\u2019) - composed for the left hand due to a right arm injury after falling on ice before a performance; this inspired him to write this piece particularly for left hand\ninfluencer duet campaign to follow for la chute - inviting people to provide their right-hand duet with Jean-Michel\n--\nCould you list some more things I could include?", "length": 3287}

{"prompt": "IN THE SUPREME COURT\nOF NEW SOUTH WALES\nEQUITY DIVISION\n\nYOUNG CJ in EQ\n\nWednesday 15 September 2004\n\n3671/04 \u2013 PRIME CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LTD v WESTBRIDGE INVESTMENTS PTY LTD\n\nJUDGMENT\n1 HIS HONOUR: By statement of liquidated claim filed in the Local Court at the Downing Centre, Sydney, on 3 February 2003 the plaintiff claimed $11,754.60, and costs, from the defendant for goods sold and delivered. The claim was disputed and both parties were represented by solicitors, a Mr Park and a Ms Lim for the plaintiff, and a Ms Williams for the defendant.\n2 On 21 January 2004 the plaintiff's solicitor made an offer that the parties settle the matter for the amount claimed, with each party to pay its own costs, with a deed of release to be entered into between the parties. On 23 January 2004 the defendant's solicitor accepted this, as a matter of principle, and Ms Williams emailed Ms Lim as follows:\n\n\u201cI attach the deed of release in this matter.\nPlease let me have any comments as I would like to prepare execution copies as soon as possible.\nFinally, I am now holding the cheque in favour of your client for $11,721.60.\u201d\n3 Mr Park accepted the deed as drafted, and on 9 February 2004 Ms Williams emailed him the deed for execution.\n4 On 12 February 2004 Mr Park emailed Ms Williams:\n\n\u201cDear Kim,\nThe terms referred to in your e-mail below is acceptable. Can you please fax me a signed copy and I will attend to its filing straight away?\nAlso, I've received the signed deed from your client today so we are now in a position to exchange deeds and the settlement cheque. Can you please advise your client that we are ready and inquire as to when the deeds can be exchanged?\u201d\n\nOn 13 February at 10.10am Ms Williams emailed back:\n\"Hi Peter\nI am informed by Les Houlton Westbridge that the deed of release has now gone to the co-director for execution.\nI will revert to you when I receive the return of the deed. In the meantime I shall print out the Terms of Settlement, sign same and forward it to you.\u201d\n5 That was the last of the \"Dear Peter\" and \"Dear Kim\" e-mails. Thereafter there was correspondence of \"Dear Sir\" or \"Dear Madam\", as the case may be.\n6 The first of these was a fax Ms Williams sent on 13 February to the effect that:\n\n\u201cWe ... have been instructed to advise that, after further consideration, our client has now reconsidered its position.\u201d\n\nAn additional term was then proposed about a letter from the plaintiff to the proprietor as to the quality of the works that had been done.\n7 This was replied to by a contention that the matter had been settled and settlement has occurred, and there was desultory correspondence between the solicitors, until Ms Williams notified Mr Park on 22 April 2004 that her firm had ceased to act for the defendant, which would be thereafter acting for itself.\n8 On about 9 February 2004 the deed, in the form which had been agreed between the solicitors, was executed in the following way; the document ended:\n\u201cEXECUTED by the parties as a deed:\n\nSIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED by\nPRIME CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED\nin the presence of:\u201d\n\nOpposite the attestation clause was the signature of a director, Mr Holmes, and that signature was witnessed by Mr Flint, who was not the secretary of the company, but was its accounting and administration manager. The so-called deed was then delivered to Mr Park by about 12 February 2004.\n9 On 28 June 2004 the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings seeking specific performance of the alleged agreement to settle the Local Court proceedings. The matter came on for hearing before me on 3 September and today.\n10 A series of questions need to be addressed:\n1. Was there a final settlement of the Local Court proceedings?\n\n2. What was the effect of the document executed on 9 February 2004?\n\n3. What is the effect of the ratification of that document on 15 September 2004, and the signing of another copy of the deed?\n\n4. What order should be made.\n\nI will deal with these matters in turn.\n11 1. There is often a problem where parties have made an agreement to settle proceedings, which agreement is to be consummated by formal documentation. As the leading case of Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353, 360 makes it clear, there can be at least three situations:\n(i) that the parties have reached a final binding agreement, but propose to have the terms re-stated in a form which will be fuller or more precise, but not different in effect;\n\n(ii) the parties have agreed, but have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document; or\n\n(iii) they have not even reached a final agreement at all.\n\nThere are other variations. It is always a matter of fact and intention.\n12 In view of the correspondence which I have set out, the fact that the terms of the deed were finally agreed upon, the terms of settlement were finally agreed upon, it seems to me that all that was left was pure mechanics and the case falls within the first of the classes in Masters v Cameron. Thus, I am satisfied that there was a final settlement of the proceedings.\n13 2. A deed is the most solemn act that a person can perform with respect to its property. Deeds have a very ancient origin and because the execution of a deed is such a solemn matter the law prescribes the way in which they are to be executed, so that it is understood by the persons executing them what a solemn legal act they are performing by being bound by a deed.\n14 The prime legislation governing the execution of deeds by corporations is s 127 of the Corporations Act 2001 and s 51A of the Conveyancing Act 1919. Section 51A enables a company to execute a deed under seal with a signature of a director and a secretary. Section 127 (2) of the Corporations Act says much the same sort of thing. However, s 127 (1) makes it clear that a company can bind itself by a deed by a less formal method. However, two directors of the company must sign the deed, or a director and a company secretary must sign the deed, and if there is only one director of a company then that director alone can sign it, and the document must be expressed to be a deed.\n15 In the instant case, while the document was expressed to be a deed, only one director signed it so there was no compliance with s 127 of the Corporations Act. As there was no seal, there was no compliance with section 51A of the Conveyancing Act.\n16 Section 127(4) of the Corporations Act makes it clear that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document, including a deed. It is not particularly clear what this covers. However, it would seem that it covers the common law method of executing a deed, or the method of executing a deed that is binding on the company, which is prescribed by the company's constitution.\n17 In the instant case, I was not favoured with a copy of the company's constitution, so there can be no reliance on the common law method of execution of a deed, which usually involves the seal and signature by the directors and secretary.\n18 However, it would seem that s 127(4) also covers the situation where, by virtue of some estoppel, the deed is binding on the company. Mr Davis, who appeared for the plaintiff, (the defendant indicated it would not attend the hearing) relied on the decision of Mackenzie J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Carter v Schmierer BC200300443. That was a case where his Honour was asked to make a declaration under s 418A of the Corporations Act that a charge was valid. I must confess, I do not read the case in the same way as Mr Davis does. It would seem that his Honour was of the view that, in all the circumstances, the document was not executed as a deed, but the mortgagor company was estopped from denying it. In the end, he declared that, insofar as it is asserted that the charge was invalid because it was not executed in accordance with s 127 of the Corporations Act, the appointment of the receivers and managers pursuant to the charge was valid. He thus, with great skill, circumvented the technical question.\n19 I have before today (see Nicom Interiors Pty Ltd v Circuit Finance Pty Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 25) pointed out how essential it is for lawyers advising companies which are executing deeds to be very careful to ensure that they are executed in accordance with s 127, or other permissible methods. Unfortunately, in the present case somewhere along the line, I do not know whose fault it is, the document which was executed on 9 February failed to comply with those standards of execution, and was not, technically speaking, a deed.\n20 If the document were a deed, then its being handed to the solicitor on about 12 February would operate as delivery. That would mean that as soon as the deed was in the hands of the solicitor it was binding on the plaintiff, and the fact that the other party had not executed the deed was no excuse for not complying with it.\n21 Accordingly, the releases given by that deed to the defendant have been in effect. The only way in which the plaintiff could have escaped from being bound by the deed, if the other party had not executed it within a reasonable time, (the deed having been delivered) was by application in equity. See Scook v Premier Building Solutions Pty Ltd (2003) 28 WAR 124; Carew's Case (No 2) (1855) 7 De GM&G 43; 44 ER 17 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Taylor (1929) 42 CLR 80.\n22 Even if there was not a proper execution of the deed, because Mr Park had represented to Ms Williams that the deed had been executed, it may well have been that estoppel would operate so that the plaintiff would be estopped from denying that the document was a deed, and if the defendant had taken that view, then the deed would have had the same operation as if it had been executed as a deed.\n23 Accordingly, on this basis, we have what is known in specific performance law as an executed contract.\n24 3. The evidence is that on 15 September, that is this morning, there was a meeting of the board of directors of the plaintiff, which both ratified the deed and also executed a new deed properly. The question is what is the effect of that?\n25 Ordinarily, ratification relates back to the time when the original act was done. There is an exception where what is to be done has to be done within a limited time; see Dibbins v Dibbins [1896] 2 Ch 348. However, that line of cases only seems to apply where time is of the essence. Here, although it may well be argued that there was only a reasonable time in which the deed could be signed and proffered, time was not of the essence, and the acts of the defendant precluded the formal document being proffered, and as the defendant never saw it, it never realised that the deed was not properly executed.\n26 Accordingly, either by estoppel, as I indicated under heading 2, or because of ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004, and the consequences flow as per para 2 of these reasons.\n27 If that is wrong, then the evidence is that the new deed was delivered this morning to the solicitor, and that would show that as at the date of hearing, which is the only relevant time, the plaintiff was ready, willing and able to fulfil the contract, so far as the same remained to be performed on its part.\n28 4. The next question is what order should be made. Where there is an executed contract, ordinarily, specific performance is granted automatically because it is unfair that one party should be bound by an agreement and the other not, when they have intended that there should be mutual rights.\n29 However, in the present case, granting specific performance creates more problems than it solves. Assuming the defendant maintains its attitude of not doing anything, then the decree for specific performance would have to be entered, someone would have to apply on motion under s 100 of the Supreme Court Act for the deed to be executed by a Registrar of the court in the name of the defendant, and then a fresh action would have to be commenced in a Local Court for debt on the specialty. In view of the amount involved, this would be a very expensive exercise indeed.\n30 It seems to me that as there is a specifically enforceable agreement, one can make a declaration that the defendant is bound by the terms of the document, which is, for instance, annexure A to Mr Drake's affidavit of 15 September 2004, including the releases contained therein, and then merely give judgment for the plaintiff for the sum referred to in the deed, namely, $11,721.60, and that is the sort of order I will make.\n31 I declare that the defendant is bound by the terms of the deed of release, annexed A to the affidavit of JDM Drake, sworn herein on 15 September 2004, as if it had signed the deed.\n32 I find a verdict for the plaintiff for $11,721.60 and order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, but no costs are to be allowed for the 15 September 2004 hearing.", "length": 3432}
{"prompt": "Rewrite this for brevity, in outline form:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1\\*P6kOmMkdlQUUtKHcDXL1Sw.jpeg)\n\n# Introduction\n\nGoogle BigQuery is an enterprise data warehouse built using BigTable and Google Cloud Platform. It\u2019s serverless and completely managed. BigQuery works great with all sizes of data, from a 100 row Excel spreadsheet to several Petabytes of data. Most importantly, it can execute a complex query on those data within a few seconds.\n\nWe need to note before we proceed, BigQuery is not a transactional database. It takes around 2 seconds to run a simple query like \u2018SELECT \\\\* FROM bigquery-public-data.object LIMIT 10\u2019 on a 100 KB table with 500 rows. Hence, it shouldn\u2019t be thought of as OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database. BigQuery is for Big Data!\n\nBigQuery supports SQL-like query, which makes it user-friendly and beginner friendly. It\u2019s accessible via its web UI, command-line tool, or client library (written in C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby). You can also take advantage of its REST APIs and get our job\\` done by sending a JSON request.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive deeper to understand it better. Suppose you are a data scientist (or a startup which analyzes data) and you need to analyze terabytes of data. If you choose a tool like MySQL, the first step before even thinking about any query is to have an infrastructure in place, that can store this magnitude of data.\n\nDesigning this setup itself will be a difficult task because you have to figure out what will be the RAM size, DCOS or Kubernetes, and other factors. And if you have streaming data coming, you will need to set up and maintain a Kafka cluster. In BigQuery, all you have to do is a bulk upload of your CSV/JSON file, and you are done. BigQuery handles all the backend for you. If you need streaming data ingestion, you can use Fluentd. Another advantage of this is that you can connect Google Analytics with BigQuery seamlessly.\n\nBigQuery is serverless, highly available, and petabyte scalable service which allows you to execute complex SQL queries quickly. It lets you focus on analysis rather than handling infrastructure. The idea of hardware is completely abstracted and not visible to us, not even as virtual machines.\n\n# The Architecture of Google BigQuery\n\nYou don\u2019t need to know too much about the underlying architecture of BigQuery. That\u2019s actually the whole idea of it \u2014 you don\u2019t need to worry about architecture and operation.\n\nHowever, understanding BigQuery Architecture helps us in controlling costs, optimizing query performance, and optimizing storage. BigQuery is built using the Google Dremel paper.\n\n\\*\\*Quoting an Abstract from the Google Dremel Paper -\\*\\*\n\n\\*\u201cDremel is a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for analysis of read-only nested data. By combining multi-level execution trees and columnar data layout, it is capable of running aggregation queries over trillion-row tables in seconds. The system scales to thousands of CPUs and petabytes of data and has thousands of users at Google. In this paper, we describe the architecture and implementation of Dremel and explain how it complements MapReduce-based computing. We present a novel columnar storage representation for nested records and discuss experiments on few-thousand node instances of the system.\u201d\\*\n\nYou can read the paper here \u2014 .\n\nDremel was in production at Google since 2006. Google used it for the following tasks -\n\n\\* Analysis of crawled web documents.\n\\* Tracking install data for applications on Android Market.\n\\* Crash reporting for Google products.\n\\* OCR results from Google Books.\n\\* Spam analysis.\n\\* Debugging of map tiles on Google Maps.\n\\* Tablet migrations in managed Bigtable instances.\n\\* Results of tests run on Google\u2019s distributed build system.\n\\* Disk I/O statistics for hundreds of thousands of disks.\n\\* Resource monitoring for jobs run in Google\u2019s data centers.\n\\* Symbols and dependencies in Google\u2019s codebase.\n\nBigQuery is much more than Dremel. Dremel is just a query execution engine, whereas Bigquery is based on interesting technologies like Borg (predecessor of Kubernetes) and Colossus. Colossus is the successor to the Google File System (GFS) as mentioned in Google Spanner Paper.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/751/1\\*oFbNKWOs-9CrLaprmTDfKA.png)\n\n# How BigQuery Stores Data?\n\nBigQuery stores data in a columnar format \u2014 Capacitor (which is a successor of ColumnarIO). BigQuery achieves very high compression ratio and scan throughput. Unlike ColumnarIO, now on BigQuery, you can directly operate on compressed data without decompressing it.\n\nColumnar storage has the following advantages:\n\n\\* \\*\\*Traffic minimization\\*\\*\u2014 When you submit a query, the required column values on each query are scanned and only those are transferred on query execution. E.g., a query \\`SELECT title FROM Collection\\` would access the title column values only.\n\\* \\*\\*Higher compression ratio\\*\\* \u2014 Columnar storage can achieve a compression ratio of 1:10, whereas ordinary row-based storage can compress at roughly 1:3.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/868/1\\*rmmUUcF-pno3IE3iq5X6Yw.png)\n\n\\*(Image source: Google Dremel Paper)\\*\n\nColumnar storage has the disadvantage of not working efficiently when updating existing records. That is why Dremel doesn\u2019t support any update queries.\n\n# How the Query Gets Executed?\n\nBigQuery depends on Borg for data processing. Borg simultaneously instantiates hundreds of Dremel jobs across required clusters made up of thousands of machines. In addition to assigning compute capacity for Dremel jobs, Borg handles fault-tolerance as well.\n\nNow, how do you design/execute a query which can run on thousands of nodes and fetches the result? This challenge was overcome by using the Tree Architecture. This architecture forms a gigantically parallel distributed tree for pushing down a query to the tree and aggregating the results from the leaves at a blazingly fast speed.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/829/1\\*FwBrz2pdhmoSlBzgQjuKWg.png)\n\n\\*(Image source: Google Dremel Paper)\\*\n\n# BigQuery vs. MapReduce\n\nThe key differences between BigQuery and MapReduce are -\n\n\\* Dremel is designed as an interactive data analysis tool for large datasets\n\\* MapReduce is designed as a programming framework to batch process large datasets\n\nMoreover, Dremel finishes most queries within seconds or tens of seconds and can even be used by non-programmers, whereas MapReduce takes much longer (sometimes even hours or days) to process a query.\n\nFollowing is a comparison on running MapReduce on a row and columnar DB:\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1\\*jEPPPfwnJNuivXzXTDZFyQ.png)\n\n\\*(Image source: Google Dremel Paper)\\*\n\nAnother important thing to note is that BigQuery is meant to analyze structured data (SQL) but in MapReduce, you can write logic for unstructured data as well.\n\n# Comparing BigQuery and Redshift\n\nIn Redshift, you need to allocate different instance types and create your own clusters. The benefit of this is that it lets you tune the compute/storage to meet your needs. However, you have to be aware of (virtualized) hardware limits and scale up/out based on that. Note that you are charged by the hour for each instance you spin up.\n\nIn BigQuery, you just upload the data and query it. It is a truly managed service. You are charged by storage, streaming inserts, and queries.\n\nThere are more similarities in both the data warehouses than the differences.\n\nA smart user will definitely take advantage of the hybrid cloud (GCE+AWS) and leverage different services offered by both the ecosystems. Check out here.\n\n# Getting Started With Google BigQuery\n\nFollowing is a quick example to show how you can quickly get started with BigQuery:\n\n1. There are many public datasets available on bigquery, you are going to play with \u2018bigquery-public-data:stackoverflow\u2019 dataset. You can click on the \u201cAdd Data\u201d button on the left panel and select datasets.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1\\*dRFs1aA3zT3pBC4vc5RE5A.png)\n\n2\\. Next, find a language which has the best community, based on the response time. You can write the following query to do that.\n\n3\\. Now you can execute the query and get results -\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1\\*igz21iSrnJ\\_jpBESK6v9wA.png)\n\nYou can see that C has the best community followed by javascript!\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/448/1\\*Rt5pJfV9OQtaKfaHKkZh8w.png)\n\n# How to do Machine Learning on BigQuery?\n\nNow that you have a sound understanding of BigQuery. It\u2019s time for some real action.\n\nAs discussed above, you can connect Google Analytics with BigQuery by going to the Google Analytics Admin panel, then enable BigQuery by clicking on PROPERTY column, click All Products, then click Link BigQuery. After that, you need to enter BigQuery ID (or project number) and then BigQuery will be linked to Google Analytics. \\*Note \u2014 Right now BigQuery integration is only available to Google Analytics 360\\*.\n\nAssuming that you already have uploaded your google analytics data, here is how you can create a logistic regression model. Here, you are predicting whether a website visitor will make a transaction or not.\n\nCreate a model named \u2018velotio\\\\_tutorial.sample\\\\_model\u2019. Now set the \u2018model\\\\_type\u2019 as \u2018logistic\\\\_reg\u2019 because you want to train a logistic regression model. A logistic regression model splits input data into two classes and gives the probability that the data is in one of the classes. Usually, in \u201cspam or not spam\u201d type of problems, you use logistic regression. Here, the problem is similar \u2014 a transaction will be made or not.\n\nThe above query gets the total number of page views, the country from where the session originated, the operating system of visitors device, the total number of e-commerce transactions within the session, etc.\n\nNow you just press run query to execute the query.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBigQuery is a query service that allows us to run SQL-like queries against multiple terabytes of data in a matter of seconds. If you have structured data, BigQuery is the best option to go for. It can help even a non-programmer to get the analytics right! Related Read \u2014 .\n\nDid we miss anything?

{"prompt": "IN THE SUPREME COURT\nOF NEW SOUTH WALES\nEQUITY DIVISION\n\nYOUNG CJ in EQ\n\nWednesday 15 September 2004\n\n3671/04 \u2013 PRIME CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LTD v WESTBRIDGE INVESTMENTS PTY LTD\n\nJUDGMENT\n1 HIS HONOUR: By statement of liquidated claim filed in the Local Court at the Downing Centre, Sydney, on 3 February 2003 the plaintiff claimed $11,754.60, and costs, from the defendant for goods sold and delivered. The claim was disputed and both parties were represented by solicitors, a Mr Park and a Ms Lim for the plaintiff, and a Ms Williams for the defendant.\n2 On 21 January 2004 the plaintiff's solicitor made an offer that the parties settle the matter for the amount claimed, with each party to pay its own costs, with a deed of release to be entered into between the parties. On 23 January 2004 the defendant's solicitor accepted this, as a matter of principle, and Ms Williams emailed Ms Lim as follows:\n\n\u201cI attach the deed of release in this matter.\nPlease let me have any comments as I would like to prepare execution copies as soon as possible.\nFinally, I am now holding the cheque in favour of your client for $11,721.60.\u201d\n3 Mr Park accepted the deed as drafted, and on 9 February 2004 Ms Williams emailed him the deed for execution.\n4 On 12 February 2004 Mr Park emailed Ms Williams:\n\n\u201cDear Kim,\nThe terms referred to in your e-mail below is acceptable. Can you please fax me a signed copy and I will attend to its filing straight away?\nAlso, I've received the signed deed from your client today so we are now in a position to exchange deeds and the settlement cheque. Can you please advise your client that we are ready and inquire as to when the deeds can be exchanged?\u201d\n\nOn 13 February at 10.10am Ms Williams emailed back:\n\"Hi Peter\nI am informed by Les Houlton Westbridge that the deed of release has now gone to the co-director for execution.\nI will revert to you when I receive the return of the deed. In the meantime I shall print out the Terms of Settlement, sign same and forward it to you.\u201d\n5 That was the last of the \"Dear Peter\" and \"Dear Kim\" e-mails. Thereafter there was correspondence of \"Dear Sir\" or \"Dear Madam\", as the case may be.\n6 The first of these was a fax Ms Williams sent on 13 February to the effect that:\n\n\u201cWe ... have been instructed to advise that, after further consideration, our client has now reconsidered its position.\u201d\n\nAn additional term was then proposed about a letter from the plaintiff to the proprietor as to the quality of the works that had been done.\n7 This was replied to by a contention that the matter had been settled and settlement has occurred, and there was desultory correspondence between the solicitors, until Ms Williams notified Mr Park on 22 April 2004 that her firm had ceased to act for the defendant, which would be thereafter acting for itself.\n8 On about 9 February 2004 the deed, in the form which had been agreed between the solicitors, was executed in the following way; the document ended:\n\u201cEXECUTED by the parties as a deed:\n\nSIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED by\nPRIME CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED\nin the presence of:\u201d\n\nOpposite the attestation clause was the signature of a director, Mr Holmes, and that signature was witnessed by Mr Flint, who was not the secretary of the company, but was its accounting and administration manager. The so-called deed was then delivered to Mr Park by about 12 February 2004.\n9 On 28 June 2004 the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings seeking specific performance of the alleged agreement to settle the Local Court proceedings. The matter came on for hearing before me on 3 September and today.\n10 A series of questions need to be addressed:\n1. Was there a final settlement of the Local Court proceedings?\n\n2. What was the effect of the document executed on 9 February 2004?\n\n3. What is the effect of the ratification of that document on 15 September 2004, and the signing of another copy of the deed?\n\n4. What order should be made.\n\nI will deal with these matters in turn.\n11 1. There is often a problem where parties have made an agreement to settle proceedings, which agreement is to be consummated by formal documentation. As the leading case of Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353, 360 makes it clear, there can be at least three situations:\n(i) that the parties have reached a final binding agreement, but propose to have the terms re-stated in a form which will be fuller or more precise, but not different in effect;\n\n(ii) the parties have agreed, but have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document; or\n\n(iii) they have not even reached a final agreement at all.\n\nThere are other variations. It is always a matter of fact and intention.\n12 In view of the correspondence which I have set out, the fact that the terms of the deed were finally agreed upon, the terms of settlement were finally agreed upon, it seems to me that all that was left was pure mechanics and the case falls within the first of the classes in Masters v Cameron. Thus, I am satisfied that there was a final settlement of the proceedings.\n13 2. A deed is the most solemn act that a person can perform with respect to its property. Deeds have a very ancient origin and because the execution of a deed is such a solemn matter the law prescribes the way in which they are to be executed, so that it is understood by the persons executing them what a solemn legal act they are performing by being bound by a deed.\n14 The prime legislation governing the execution of deeds by corporations is s 127 of the Corporations Act 2001 and s 51A of the Conveyancing Act 1919. Section 51A enables a company to execute a deed under seal with a signature of a director and a secretary. Section 127 (2) of the Corporations Act says much the same sort of thing. However, s 127 (1) makes it clear that a company can bind itself by a deed by a less formal method. However, two directors of the company must sign the deed, or a director and a company secretary must sign the deed, and if there is only one director of a company then that director alone can sign it, and the document must be expressed to be a deed.\n15 In the instant case, while the document was expressed to be a deed, only one director signed it so there was no compliance with s 127 of the Corporations Act. As there was no seal, there was no compliance with section 51A of the Conveyancing Act.\n16 Section 127(4) of the Corporations Act makes it clear that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document, including a deed. It is not particularly clear what this covers. However, it would seem that it covers the common law method of executing a deed, or the method of executing a deed that is binding on the company, which is prescribed by the company's constitution.\n17 In the instant case, I was not favoured with a copy of the company's constitution, so there can be no reliance on the common law method of execution of a deed, which usually involves the seal and signature by the directors and secretary.\n18 However, it would seem that s 127(4) also covers the situation where, by virtue of some estoppel, the deed is binding on the company. Mr Davis, who appeared for the plaintiff, (the defendant indicated it would not attend the hearing) relied on the decision of Mackenzie J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Carter v Schmierer BC200300443. That was a case where his Honour was asked to make a declaration under s 418A of the Corporations Act that a charge was valid. I must confess, I do not read the case in the same way as Mr Davis does. It would seem that his Honour was of the view that, in all the circumstances, the document was not executed as a deed, but the mortgagor company was estopped from denying it. In the end, he declared that, insofar as it is asserted that the charge was invalid because it was not executed in accordance with s 127 of the Corporations Act, the appointment of the receivers and managers pursuant to the charge was valid. He thus, with great skill, circumvented the technical question.\n19 I have before today (see Nicom Interiors Pty Ltd v Circuit Finance Pty Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 25) pointed out how essential it is for lawyers advising companies which are executing deeds to be very careful to ensure that they are executed in accordance with s 127, or other permissible methods. Unfortunately, in the present case somewhere along the line, I do not know whose fault it is, the document which was executed on 9 February failed to comply with those standards of execution, and was not, technically speaking, a deed.\n20 If the document were a deed, then its being handed to the solicitor on about 12 February would operate as delivery. That would mean that as soon as the deed was in the hands of the solicitor it was binding on the plaintiff, and the fact that the other party had not executed the deed was no excuse for not complying with it.\n21 Accordingly, the releases given by that deed to the defendant have been in effect. The only way in which the plaintiff could have escaped from being bound by the deed, if the other party had not executed it within a reasonable time, (the deed having been delivered) was by application in equity. See Scook v Premier Building Solutions Pty Ltd (2003) 28 WAR 124; Carew's Case (No 2) (1855) 7 De GM&G 43; 44 ER 17 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Taylor (1929) 42 CLR 80.\n22 Even if there was not a proper execution of the deed, because Mr Park had represented to Ms Williams that the deed had been executed, it may well have been that estoppel would operate so that the plaintiff would be estopped from denying that the document was a deed, and if the defendant had taken that view, then the deed would have had the same operation as if it had been executed as a deed.\n23 Accordingly, on this basis, we have what is known in specific performance law as an executed contract.\n24 3. The evidence is that on 15 September, that is this morning, there was a meeting of the board of directors of the plaintiff, which both ratified the deed and also executed a new deed properly. The question is what is the effect of that?\n25 Ordinarily, ratification relates back to the time when the original act was done. There is an exception where what is to be done has to be done within a limited time; see Dibbins v Dibbins [1896] 2 Ch 348. However, that line of cases only seems to apply where time is of the essence. Here, although it may well be argued that there was only a reasonable time in which the deed could be signed and proffered, time was not of the essence, and the acts of the defendant precluded the formal document being proffered, and as the defendant never saw it, it never realised that the deed was not properly executed.\n26 Accordingly, either by estoppel, as I indicated under heading 2, or because of ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004, and the consequences flow as per para 2 of these reasons.\n27 If that is wrong, then the evidence is that the new deed was delivered this morning to the solicitor, and that would show that as at the date of hearing, which is the only relevant time, the plaintiff was ready, willing and able to fulfil the contract, so far as the same remained to be performed on its part.\n28 4. The next question is what order should be made. Where there is an executed contract, ordinarily, specific performance is granted automatically because it is unfair that one party should be bound by an agreement and the other not, when they have intended that there should be mutual rights.\n29 However, in the present case, granting specific performance creates more problems than it solves. Assuming the defendant maintains its attitude of not doing anything, then the decree for specific performance would have to be entered, someone would have to apply on motion under s 100 of the Supreme Court Act for the deed to be executed by a Registrar of the court in the name of the defendant, and then a fresh action would have to be commenced in a Local Court for debt on the specialty. In view of the amount involved, this would be a very expensive exercise indeed.\n30 It seems to me that as there is a specifically enforceable agreement, one can make a declaration that the defendant is bound by the terms of the document, which is, for instance, annexure A to Mr Drake's affidavit of 15 September 2004, including the releases contained therein, and then merely give judgment for the plaintiff for the sum referred to in the deed, namely, $11,721.60, and that is the sort of order I will make.\n31 I declare that the defendant is bound by the terms of the deed of release, annexed A to the affidavit of JDM Drake, sworn herein on 15 September 2004, as if it had signed the deed.\n32 I find a verdict for the plaintiff for $11,721.60 and order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, but no costs are to be allowed for the 15 September 2004 hearing.", "length": 3432}
{"prompt": "Give me feedback on how to improve this essay: Jane Eyre (Argument) \nIn \u201cJane Eyre\u201d we are introduced to a girl that is faced with a lot of challenges. These \nchallenges influence her in many ways to her decisions that she has made throughout the novel. \nGoing from facing her parent\u2019s death and growing up as an orphan who is raised by a cruel aunt, \nto growing up learning how to raise herself and find happiness through rough times. Even \ndealing with the decision of possibly having to let go of the man she is in love with because of \nhis dishonesty. Most of all she is challenged in choosing what is more important to her to stay \nindependent or to kill her loneliness with a man that she is in love with named Rochester, with \nthe risks of him being a false appearance to what she met him as. The difference between \nloneliness and independence for Jane is loneliness is her feeling of emotions that helps her \nachieve independence which is providing for herself, and creating stability to seek happiness.\nJane is being raised at a place called Gateshead by the Reed\u2019s, a very wealthy family. She \nis sent there by her kind uncle Reed after her parents die from a disease called typhus. While she \nis there she is mistreated by her cruel aunt Reed. When a fight breaks out between a cousin and \nher she is punished for throwing a book at his face and is blamed for the cause of it. Her aunt \nplaces her in a room referred to as the \u201cred room\u201d where her uncle dies, and while she is in there \nshe believes that she sees his ghostly spirit and it frightens her into a shock and she passes out. \nThis sets Jane off and she is facing a problem with feeling that she is singled out in the family \nand wants to neglect them because of her mistreating. Although there are some people who are \nnicer to her that work in Gateshead, her aunt gives her a title of being a liar from all the false \nstatements that Jane makes to them. I believe that she is feeling this way because she has lost \nrespect for her aunt Reed and really wants to neglect her. Jane says \u201cI am glad that you are no \nrelation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you \n2\nwhen I am grown up; and if anyone asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say \nthe very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\u201d (95) \nMrs. Reed\u2019s reaction was shocking, but Jane was entitled to her own opinion and that is how she \nfelt about her aunt that promised to take good care of her when her parents were dying. \nJane\u2019s actions show that she wants to leave and she already has her mind made up that \nshe is going to leave but doesn\u2019t know when. This is the set off to Jane and her structuring life to \ngrowing up being independent. Jane is struck with news that she will be sent off to school to a \nplace called Lowood. She meets a seemingly nice principal named Mr. Brocklehurst before \nattending and she thinks that this is going to be the beginning of a possible happy life until she \narrives and sees otherwise. Jane quickly meets a girl that she becomes really close with at \nLowood that sticks with her through humiliation that she goes through at school named Helen. \nWhen Helen lets her know that the school she is at is a school for charity maintained for female \norphans, you can imagine the thoughts that were going through her head that she was not wanted \nat Gateshead. She is a young girl that just feels alone in the world that she lives in. This \ninfluenced her to grow up being independent as well, with the guidance of her strong faith in \nGod and her religion to keep her going. She uses her faith as guidance to where she will continue \nher life and move forward to what she feels God wants her to do. While she was at school the \nReed\u2019s sent a message with the Principal that Jane was a compulsive liar and that she was pretty \nmuch unmoral. Jane realizes that she is at a really strict school and when a event happened that \nJane was accused for Mr. Brocklehurst put Jane on a pedal stool and told everyone that she was a \nliar and to not associate with her. Though Helen stuck with her and attempted to lift her spirits \ntelling her that most of the girls felt pittier for her than looking at her as guilt Jane still feels \nalone. \n3\nWhen Helen soon dies from consumption Jane is further more upset than anything and \nfeels that it is not meant for her to have anyone close in her life. Jane quotes to herself \u201cI \nremembered descending that hill at twilight: an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which \nbrought me first to Lowood; and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at \nschool: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever \nbeen to visit me. I had no communication by letter or message with the outer world.\u201d(151) Jane \nis reminiscing her past and this is symbolizing her loneliness, she is further more believing that it \nis meant for her to be alone in the world that she is living in and that her independence was \ncreated from this. The difference of her feeling alone is to fulfill her happiness and her \nindependence is to assure herself that she can still make it without depending on anyone. She \ngrows in to a woman that wants to have her own stableness. What\u2019s bizarre about this quality of \nJane is that she lives in a era that women do not work to have their own stableness unless they \ninherit it. Women were known to depend on their husband to take care of them and their \nfamilies.\nLater Jane grows up and moves away from Lowood to a place called Thornfield where \nshe is starting her life and tutors a girl named Adele. While she is there, she is introduced to a \nman named Rochester who is uncharacteristic when he first meets her, but eventually pulls the \nattention out of Jane with his strong personality. Jane eventually finds herself attracted and \nfalling for Rochester after saving his life from a fire. \u201cAnd was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my \neyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the \nobject I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.\u201d(220) \nshe is showing that her feelings for Rochester is there and even though she may have seen some \nfaults in him the actual attention she had from him made her feel wanted. Something that she has \n4\nnot felt in a long time, the fact that it was an event that caught her off guard she refuses to let her \nguard down immediately but she will cherish the moments she gets from his attention. The \nfeeling of being lonely has started to fade and she realizes that the attention she gets from him \nmakes her feel happy. \u201cBut I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and former faults of \nmorality had their source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better \ntendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, \neducation instilled, or destiny encouraged.\u201d(220) I believe that this is faith in Jane\u2019s personality, \nand the past that she came from where people who has mistreated her had never gave her the \ntime or belief that they had a better side of them. Rochester with some faults still has a better side \nand can still cheer her up with just associating makes him potentially tolerant to Jane.\nJane has the ability to consider Rochester\u2019s faults because she mentions when talking to \nherself that she would be willing to satisfy his grief, whenever he might be moody she has the \nheart of a teddy bear. \u201cI cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would \nhave given much to assuage it.\u201d (220) Why would someone who has never been treated good by \nsomeone she loved be willing to fix what she does not necessarily like? Jane\u2019s feign for \nhappiness is followed by her obsession of attention and satisfying from the absent of loneliness \nwhich Rochester shows her these qualities. Meanwhile as Jane is asked to join a party that is \nfilled with elegant and aristocratic guest. Blanche Ingram and her mother are ahead of the party \nmembers and they treat Jane with distain and cruelty, Jane does not take this well and leaves in \ntears before she is stopped by Rochester who catches her down emotions. He lets her leave \nbecause she is upset but he tells her that he wants her to come by the drawing room every \nevening during his guests company at Thornfield. \u201c Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand \nthat so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening: it is \n5\nmy wish; don\u2019t neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adele. Goodnight my ---\u201c He stopped, \nbit his lip, and abruptly left me.\u201d (259) I believe Jane catches on to this as she might have \nenjoyed this ever more than she speaks right away. Jane knows that Rochester is showing \naffection and cares about her and to see her on a everyday occasion. This is the affection that \nmakes Jane feel less lonely and makes her happy inside.\nJane desperately travels back to Gateshead when she hears her aunt Reed is dying, while \nshe is there she is presented with a old letter and news that she has family that wants to adopt her \nand share with her some of their wealth, that she later gets in the novel. She is away for a couple \nof months and gets news that Rochester had went to buy a new carriage, something intended for \na marriage. Jane\u2019s feelings for Rochester are addressed more by the narrator when she returns \nback to Thornfield. She shocks herself when she expresses to Rochester how she missed him \nwhile they were away from each other. \u201cThank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am \nstrangely glad to get back to you; and wherever you are is my home, my home only home.\u201d (330) \nThis is an example of Jane\u2019s happiness from the presence of Rochester. She feels that she is no \nlonger lonely when it comes to people she is encountered with. Although her independence still \ntakes place when she has taken it upon herself to travel to Gateshead alone and see her aunt Reed \nthat dies. Jane\u2019s faith in God fortunately guides her to finding out that she has family that she \neventually inherits wealth from. Post acceptance to Rochester\u2019s proposal she contacts her uncle \nJohn Eyre and lets him know of her wedding. John makes Jane his heir and she is now equal \nfooting to Rochester. This makes Jane more comfortable to marrying Rochester, and satisfies her \ndoubts that the wedding possibly will not happen. \u201cDo you remember what you said of Celine \nVarens? Of the diamonds, the cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Celine Varens. \nI shall continue to act as Adele\u2019s governess: by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty \n6\npounds a year besides. I\u2019ll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me \nnothing but.\u201d (356) Jane\u2019s independence is shown here when she expresses to Rochester that she \nwill not marry him until she is able to have her own stability. She uses a lady that Rochester had \nencounters with in the past that he nourished, and she explicitly says that she will not be that \nwoman; that she will not depend on Rochester. Jane\u2019s pride has made her more compelling to \nRochester and it makes his love for her stronger.\nAwaiting their marriage another tragic event happens that postpones the wedding even \nlonger. While there was a first attempt to a wedding, Rochester strangely tries to resume the \nceremony as someone quickly interrupts and rejects why they should get married. Rochester is \nconfronted with the news and proof that he was still married to another woman named Bertha. \nWhile they crowd was invited to see why she was kept a secret Jane departures herself for a \nwhile until she recovers. While this crazy event was happening Jane picked up her inherited five \nthousand pounds that was split between her and her cousins. Rochester is blinded by a fire that \nhappens at Thornfield when it is burned down and his legally married wife Bertha was killed in \nthat fire attempting to kill Rochester. Jane is left with twenty thousand pounds when her uncle \nJohn dies and eventually gets back to Rochester. With the drama that has diluted and faded away \nJane and Rochester picked up where they stopped and ends up getting married. It is important to \nknow that Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight and she still seeks the love she had for him. \nJane and Rochester had been married happily for ten years, after two years in to their marriage \nthey have a baby boy and Rochester claims to be getting his sight back in one eye when he says \nhe is able to see their son when he holds him for the first time. \nJane completes a life of struggle and tough challenges through faith and pride. Her belief \nin God and using his guidance lead her to a life that she never thought she would have growing \n7\nup as a little girl. She survives through her times of loneliness and provides herself with the \nability to be independent to seek happiness. Jane shows the definition and the difference of \nloneliness and independence. She uses her feelings of emotions to motivate her to achieve \nindependence by assuring that she will be able provide for herself before she completes her life \nwith happiness. She seeks happiness when she realizes that she has love in her life but refuses to \ntake the offer of love until she was able to create stability by being independent in the process. \nJane ends up being of more fortune of Rochester and still being able to have the love she wanted \nwith him by sticking with her faith and pride and guidance from the love of God. The story and \nrough journey of Jane Eyre, ends up being the happy Jane Rochester.", "length": 3473}

I\u2019ll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but.\u201d (356) Jane\u2019s independence is shown here when she expresses to Rochester that she will not marry him until she is able to have her own stability. She uses a lady that Rochester had encounters with in the past that he nourished, and she explicitly says that she will not be that woman; that she will not depend on Rochester. Jane\u2019s pride has made her more compelling to Rochester and it makes his love for her stronger. Awaiting their marriage another tragic event happens that postpones the wedding even longer. While there was a first attempt to a wedding, Rochester strangely tries to resume the ceremony as someone quickly interrupts and rejects why they should get married. Rochester is confronted with the news and proof that he was still married to another woman named Bertha. While they crowd was invited to see why she was kept a secret Jane departures herself for a while until she recovers. While this crazy event was happening Jane picked up her inherited five thousand pounds that was split between her and her cousins. Rochester is blinded by a fire that happens at Thornfield when it is burned down and his legally married wife Bertha was killed in that fire attempting to kill Rochester. Jane is left with twenty thousand pounds when her uncle John dies and eventually gets back to Rochester. With the drama that has diluted and faded away Jane and Rochester picked up where they stopped and ends up getting married. It is important to know that Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight and she still seeks the love she had for him. Jane and Rochester had been married happily for ten years, after two years in to their marriage they have a baby boy and Rochester claims to be getting his sight back in one eye when he says he is able to see their son when he holds him for the first time. Jane completes a life of struggle and tough challenges through faith and pride. Her belief in God and using his guidance lead her to a life that she never thought she would have growing 7 up as a little girl. She survives through her times of loneliness and provides herself with the ability to be independent to seek happiness. Jane shows the definition and the difference of loneliness and independence. She uses her feelings of emotions to motivate her to achieve independence by assuring that she will be able provide for herself before she completes her life with happiness. She seeks happiness when she realizes that she has love in her life but refuses to take the offer of love until she was able to create stability by being independent in the process. Jane ends up being of more fortune of Rochester and still being able to have the love she wanted with him by sticking with her faith and pride and guidance from the love of God. The story and rough journey of Jane Eyre, ends up being the happy Jane Rochester.", "length": 3104}
{"prompt": ".1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nBelow is the payment determinzation algotrhism for an healthcare alternative payment model. I need you to write Stata code to create a dataset with simulated ACR, UAMCC, and DAH measure scores. the ACR measure has 1010 observations, following a normal distribution ranging from 14 to 17; the UAMCC measure has 1005 observations, following a uniform distribution ranging from 45 to 85; the DAH measure has 1000 observations, ranging from 250 to 350 following a normal distribution. The variable that captures unique healthcare org ID is DCE\\_ID. Please make sure none of the DCE has all the three measure scores missing. Then create a Stata code to apply to this simulated dataset, to compute the Final Earn-Back Rate for every DCE. If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------For PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final\n \n\nreconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1.", "length": 3089}
{"prompt": "The transcript continues with:\n[00:14:08.210] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. That was the number one question we got over the past two years is should we fundraise right now? Does our cause matter as much? Will it appear tone deaf? And we said yes, and for sure it matters. But you can do that in such a way that it won\u2019t appear tone deaf. Like maybe saying, hey, we want to be around because we want to be able to provide. People need entertainment, people need art, right? What more important time is there to have art in your life than these truly difficult times? So that case is there. And that\u2019s where I think that contextualization is what made those appeals successful, rather than just saying, hey, it\u2019s a pandemic you should give to our orchestra. It\u2019s like, wait, why, do you mean? Go that level deeper and really tug on those heartstrings and unlock what it is those people have always kind of cared about you. But yeah, I can\u2019t think of another cause that matters more in darker times than those performing arts folks. So my heart goes out to them. And I hope that so many of them will be able to stick around because we need you.\n\n[00:15:19.980] \u2013 Boris\nAbsolutely. I\u2019m a fan, of course, of the arts. But on Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, the arts might not be at the bottom, but they\u2019re on there. They\u2019re self actualization and they are education. They are force for good. I don\u2019t have to sell people, especially those folks in the arts. But I found it honestly a little disheartening how a lot of arts organizations felt about themselves and their work.\n\n[00:15:47.790] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the thing.\n\n[00:15:49.150] \u2013 Boris\nThey didn\u2019t know how to speak to their existing base and to try to grow their base during this time of upheaval.\n\n[00:15:58.530] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nThat\u2019s the heartbreaking thing for me. You mentioned the webinar series. We were doing a webinar, probably March or April 2020. One of the attendees chatted in like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just a library foundation. We\u2019re not saving lives.\u201d And I kind of grabbed the microphone from my guest and I said, \u201cNo, my gosh, people need the arts.\u201d They need books, right? I told the story of my kids. We love to go to the library every Saturday morning. It\u2019s one of their favorite activities. We want that to be there when we can finally get back out of the house in a safe way. That\u2019s the situation we find ourselves back in. So that to me is, don\u2019t sell yourself short, right? Because there will be another crisis, like you said, Boris, and you will not only matter, but you may even be more critical, especially to the people that already care and hold that cause near and dear to your heart. So I hope people find this encouraging. That\u2019s kind of how I think you mean it, too. And I definitely mean it because there will be something else that happens.\n\n[00:17:00.710] \u2013 Boris\nSo we teased since the beginning of the episode, we teased that we\u2019ve got data that we\u2019ve got data on what\u2019s going on, what was working, what wasn\u2019t working. And I personally want to hear it because I haven\u2019t gotten it yet. And I\u2019ve read some of the reports out there. But talk to me, Steven. What happened during the pandemic, what\u2019s going on now and what\u2019s not working?\n\n[00:17:24.940] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWell, aside from asking and not putting ourselves on the sidelines, that was definitely a big one. But we also looked at those folks that were doing well and maybe even doing better than in past years. A couple of things stood out. The prevalence of phone calls. So we\u2019re a donor database so we can see what kind of interactions people are making with their donors and in what format. And we saw phone calls not only shoot up, probably because we couldn\u2019t do events and maybe even direct mail was harder, but not only were more phone calls being made to supporters, but we could really see that they were moving the needle on things like revenue and donor retention and things like that.\n\n[00:18:09.700] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I think it\u2019s because especially in 2020, we were isolated. We were social distanced. That phone call from a nonprofit to a supporter, that may have been one of the only few personal interactions that they encountered and probably the only one from a brand, right? From someone who wasn\u2019t a friend or a family member or a co-worker. That not only made a big difference in 2020, but again, it continued to have efficacy through 2021. And I think for all the reasons I just said, but also because it\u2019s so surprising to get a phone call that\u2019s a pure thank you or is showing curiosity about why you support. And I sound kind of cynical and I hate to be surprised, but that\u2019s kind of rare, right? I can count on maybe one hand how many times that\u2019s happened to me from a nonprofit or anything that I\u2019ve supported.\n\n[00:19:04.490] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nPersonal emails, same thing. So there\u2019s mass emails where you set up an email blast to all the people in your database, all 2000 of them or whatever. We also saw people reaching out individually, you know, me literally opening up Gmail, writing an email to Boris, like, \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for having me on the show. You\u2019re awesome. Let\u2019s stay in touch.\u201d The same thing not only increased, but also did have an effect on that year over year kind of revenue increases. So the last two years were this kind of re-emergence, at least from our view, of truly personal outreach. And again, what better time? And maybe that\u2019s what spurred it on, because we couldn\u2019t do things like events or in-person interactions or things like that. So that was the only alternative. But I think it opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes to like, wow, maybe we should make this a normal thing that we do during any kind of climate or crisis, if there is one, because people give to people, right? And fundraising is very relationship driven, you know, this.\n\n[00:20:10.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nBut I feel like because of all this technology available to us, maybe those kind of analog or one to one or old school formats or mediums have kind of gone by the wayside but did come back because of pure necessity, right? Because that\u2019s all there was out there. And I hope that that sticks around because there\u2019s always been evidence that those things are impactful. But we really saw those things be even more impactful over the last two years. So another thing that I\u2019ve been shouting from the rooftop: reach out to people, because it is very personal.\n\n[00:20:45.410] \u2013 Boris\nSo there was a lot of great stuff in there that I want to touch on and really highlight. And I\u2019m really glad that you said people give to people because earlier you had said nonprofits reaching out to individuals. It\u2019s not nonprofits that are on the phone. You\u2019re a person at your nonprofit. And you said how many brands do that. I don\u2019t remember any time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m wearing a Banana Republic sweater; Banana Republic has never called me and asked, \u201cHey, Boris, how are you doing with this pandemic or with this crisis in Ukraine?\n\n[00:21:19.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nRight. It would be weird.\n\n[00:21:21.260] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly. It would be weird. It might be interesting, but they don\u2019t care. They care. \u201cHey, Boris, here\u2019s a coupon, maybe come back and spend some more money.\u201d\n\n[00:21:30.560] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nGet the matching tie.\n\n[00:21:31.940] \u2013 Boris\nYeah, exactly.\n\n[00:21:33.240] \u2013 Boris\nWhereas a nonprofit does care, hopefully does care about its constituents, about its supporters, certainly about its clients, has things to say and has questions to ask. You\u2019ve got to ask, you\u2019ve got to be curious. Not just, \u201cHey, why do you support us,\u201d but also \u201chow are you doing?\u201d Reinforce that connection.\n\n[00:21:53.100] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nAnd I would imagine that was the question behind a lot of that outreach, either by phone or by email. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Boris, you\u2019re a monthly donor. We want to say thanks, but also wanted to say, are you okay? This is a tough time. We just want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d And you\u2019re right. Like buying a shirt is not personal, but donating to a cancer charity because your grandmother passed away from that form of cancer, that\u2019s very personal. So to be able to reach back out, acknowledge it, yeah, but learn that information. I love the word you used, showing curiosity. I think that\u2019s something that we definitely suffer from as a fundraising sector is, why do these people support us? And there is most often than not a story behind that, maybe not as much as during times of crisis where you\u2019re kind of driven by that urgent need and not necessarily care about that cause. And I know you and Tim talked about that, and that kind of giving definitely does happen. But a lot of the gifts, there\u2019s probably a very personal reason behind it. If that can be the conversation starter, that\u2019s a pretty darn powerful conversation.\n\n[00:23:02.030] \u2013 Boris\nSo I do want to ask, though, you mentioned in your CRM you might have 2000 folks on your list. I don\u2019t know which organization has the bandwidth to personally call 2000 people. How do you navigate that? It seems almost cold to prioritize certain people over others. Is there a strategy that you recommend that you\u2019ve seen work or think is a good way to go?\n\n[00:23:28.410] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nYeah, I\u2019m glad you asked, because it\u2019s hard. And there\u2019s tons of people like me who are saying, like, you\u2019re not doing enough, and here are 20 things you should be doing. And I get it. It\u2019s hard. And if you\u2019ve got that big data set, I think there are a couple of low hanging fruit. I mentioned first-time donors. That\u2019s one where we have the data and we\u2019ll share and we can link it in the show notes, I suppose. But the phone calls really work. They really do seem to have an effect on not just retention rates, but the speed in which you received a second gift. That window really shortens if they\u2019ve been called and they tend to give more. And I think it comes down again to curiosity, right? So you call them. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks so much for your first gift. Happy to have you join our community of donors. By the way, why did you give? What spurred that gift today?\u201d And if you can learn or get that story, that will help you subsequently communicate to them, right? And sort of contextualize that reason for giving.\n\n[00:24:30.620] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nSo I love first-time donors as a priority. If you get a phone number, and you\u2019re not always going to have a phone number and I don\u2019t recommend you go out and try to find their phone number, like call their employer, that would be a little weird. But if you got a first-time gift and they gave you a phone number, if maybe it was not required on the form or they offered it up somehow, that\u2019s almost an invitation. So that\u2019s probably going to take that list of 2000 down to under ten because it may not happen very often. And maybe that\u2019s doable in an hour or so on a Friday afternoon, call those people, say thanks, welcome them, maybe find out a little bit about that motivation. Monthly donors, that\u2019s one that maybe flies a little under the radar because it\u2019s happening automatically. Maybe the dollar amounts are small; $5 a month doesn\u2019t seem like that much. Although over the lifetime, that\u2019s a pretty significant lifetime value. \u201cHey, Boris, thanks for being a monthly donor. You\u2019re keeping the lights on. Just want to say thanks, check in with you, make sure you\u2019re doing okay. How\u2019s the family?\u201d Whatever it is, that kind of outreach.\n\n[00:25:37.550] \u2013 Steven Shattuck\nWhat are those segments? Get out the whiteboard and write down like, who are those people? First-time donors, monthly donors, lapsed donors. People who have been giving for a long time. Everybody will probably have those. But depending on your cause type, volunteers, alumni, former service recipients, people who have adopted animals from us, who are those types of people? And then you can kind of decide, okay, what do we want to say to these people? Can we automate some of these things? Should we ask for different things from these people? Go through that exercise and identify it.", "length": 3288}

This force only exists in the\n59 fringing field, where the intensity of the electric field\n60 varies rapidly. The third term is the electrostrictive force,\n \n\n2.6 Pressure equation\n \n3 The pressure equation comes from momentum equation\n4 by substituting the following Equation (50) into the\n5 momentum equation. The pressure equation gives as\n \n\n \n30 where t is the thickness of the dielectric layer, \u03c3 is the\n31 gas-to-liquid interfacial tension, \u03b5r is the permittivity of\n32 free space, \u03b5 is its relative dielectric constant and V is the\n33 applied voltage. \u03b80 is the contact angle without applied\n34 voltage.\n35\n36 The limitation of the Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation is that\n37 the static contact angle vs. applied voltage can be\n38 described by assuming the errors associated with the\n39 uniform-surface-charge are small. Therefore, the\n40 following two assumptions are made for Equation (52).\n41 First, contact angle hysteresis cannot be predicted from\n42 static electrowetting. Secondly, the uniform-charge\n43 assumption is quite inaccurate at the triple point. Thus\n44 Equation (52) gives a good qualitative description of the\n45 contact angle changes with voltage but is insufficient to\nquantitatively predict droplet motion. In order to validate\nwith the Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation, we applied\n47 Equation (33) to solve for the electrophoretic force. Due\n48 to the assumptions in Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation, the\n49 dielectrophoretic and electrostrictive force are negligible.\n50 Then Equation (21) is used to calculate the electric\n51 charge density. The computational setup and boundary\n52 conditions can be found in Figure 10. The parameters are\n53 listed in Table 5.\n54\n \n\nFigure 10 Schematic of the eletrowetting model\n\nFigure 11 shows our preliminary results of the shape of bubbles at different voltages. The potential contour in the bubble varies greatly because the bubble has a smaller electric conductivity than DI water. The contour lines are densely concentrated near the bubble angle, which indicates the internal force along the two-phase interface. The arrow indicates the direction of electric force. Obviously, this force pushes the interface inward and changes the apparent contact angle. According to the Young-Lippmann\u2019s equation, the final contact angle is 84\u00ba and it correlates well with the simulation result at 200V.\n \n55 Table 5 Parameters in the electrowetting model \n56 Properties Water Dielectric layer Air \n \nFigure 11 Evolution of bubble shapes\n\nFigure 12 shows the velocity vectors at different time steps. The red color region on the figure shows the\n \n1\n2\n3 maximum velocity and the blue color region shows\n4 minimum velocity. At the initial stage, the velocity\n5 vector starts from the corner of the bubble due to the\n6 electrical force and forms a circulation in the interior\n7 bubble. When V=0V (t=0.01s in Figure 12), the vapor\n8 bubble has an obtuse contact angle (~103\u00b0) after the\n9 hydrophobic surface is stabilized. When t=0.02s, the\n10 bottom of the bubble begins to recoil due to the reduction\n11 of the apparent contact angle. The sudden contraction of\n12 the bubble produces a disturbance, which propagates\n13 upward from t=0.02s to 0.03s along the bubble surface in\n14 the form of capillary waves. In this capillary driven flow,\n15 there is a clockwise flow at the interior of the bubble and\n16 a counter-clockwise flow at the exterior of the bubble.\n17 The circular fluid motion that originates from around the\n18 triple contact point drive the recoiling of bubble. Until\n19 t=0.04s, the contact angle reaches to its final stage. The\nlarge clockwise recirculation flow at the interior of\nbubble becomes a counter-clockwise recirculation flow.\n21 However, a small clockwise circulation flow still exists\n22 at the triple contact point. The size of clockwise\n23 circulation flow at the triple contact point decreases from\n24 t=0.01s to 0.04s.

{"prompt": "Summarize the following.\nTitle: \"(2) A.I. Tries 20 Jobs | WIRED - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"I'm a lawyer copywriter Doctor music producer personal trainer software engineer DJ I want to know can AI do my job I'm a software engineer where I work we're always trying to know where can I find the best craft beer please generate the code for a website using HTML CSS and flask that tells me where there's craft beer near me this is just raw code you actually need to run the code somewhere I'm copying pasting the code into separate files and it generates a website how cool here's our website all three pieces the back end the front end and The Styling did actually make something that was human readable that that generates a website that we can look at and understand what it does does seem like a huge feat to me I'm a doctor this prompt is something that a patient might enter I have a fever rash and body aches the rash looks like small welds on my genitals do I have monkey pox the response is pretty solid in the sense that it's unlikely that you have monkey pox the specific thing I got right was that the monkey pox rash is actually not prominent on the genital area it goes on to say that a rash in the general area most likely is an STI the rest of the answer is just fluff talking to your healthcare provider which is pretty obvious can AI do my job I don't think it's there yet I think the AI right now is really good for a first year medical student I'm a graphic designer Rebrand the McDonald's logo as vegan I'm seeing four image variations it's struggling with text it's looking sort of like characters but in some sort of fictional language I wouldn't send any of these straight away to McDonald's they do each need a little bit of work the fourth one I think is maybe the strongest it's leaning towards more organic colors overall I don't think AI can do my job I kind of see this as a more evolved Pinterest I can use it as a base for inspiration but I don't think it will replace me all together or so I hope I'm a therapist people come to me when they want help in dating or relationships please answer the following question in a way a relationship therapist would why do I always fight with my partners conflicts are a natural part of any relationship fighting or arguing is not necessarily a sign of a bad relationship great some possible factors include communication issues stress and life events different conflict styles how do I know what my conflict style is reflect on your past conflicts observe your behavior during conflicts most people are incapable of reflecting on their conflict style during conflicts so while this is great information I'm not sure how actionable it is what AI has done is it's just dumped a bunch of information were I to be a client I would probably want my money back that's just me so can AI do my job I would say have self-help books done my job people don't lack knowledge they lack the ability to follow through I'm a stand-up comedian and I want to know if an AI can do my job write a 100 word minimum funny stand-up comedy joke let me go ahead and perform this and we'll see what we got online dating what a wild ride that is you know what they say swipe right for love and left for well probably just another cat person but hey at least it's better than meeting someone at a bar and realizing you have the same dad again like what side are you using ancestry.com that's a little creepy it has the Cadence right which is what's so fascinating to me and it's kind of creeping me out I did think it was cute when it was like oh swipe left on a cat person although let's be honest that's a little feline phobic I'm not concerned about the AI yet it could take a crappier comedian's job but it can't take mine I'm a lawyer my client is asking me whether or not they can sell someone's health information please write a legal memorandum about this in a true legal memorandum it would give you which sections of the regulation you're talking about which this is not doing it doesn't say what the penalties are is it criminal is it civil I don't really know where it's getting its information I don't know how much I can trust this if it were like a legal associate I would say go back and do a better job I'm a news anchor I want to know if AI can do my job I have given the AEI some text to read a forest fire has blazed through a large part of the Southern mountain region of the country she didn't sound natural he sounded like a machine speaking the lips look weird it looked like the lips did not belong to the face and provide Aid to those affected when I speak I'm moving my hands but I'm also moving some of my body she wasn't doing that I do a newscast in Spanish now let's see how it does with the Spanish newscast on incendio Forrestal ha effectado una Grand Park de la region it sucked in Spanish she actually threw in some Spanglish there miles to Hector is and the accent I have Casado she definitely struggled there the AI cannot take my job for now I'm a bartender surprise me with a Twist on a Negroni and give it a name fill a mixing glass with ice add the Gin Campari and sweet vermouth gently muddle two to three fresh Sage leaves in the glass stir the mixture until well chilled Express the orange peel over the drink release the oils and use it as a garnish there you go you have your Sage Negroni so it's a good classic Negroni I'm not really getting sage just adding the sage leaves was not very creative AI didn't ask me any follow-up questions I would say what do you like is there a style of gin that you like I think if you want to have a truly bespoke cocktail you gotta go see a bartender I'm a screenwriter I'm going to give this AI a prompt that describes a scene in my latest movie and to see how well it can match it in this scene set in 1949 three World War II widows toast their younger sister Ruby's wedding exterior Beach day Mildred Shirley and Charlotte Frolic at the shoreline of the beach and may you never have to experience the Heartbreak that we did the character literally says exactly what like you want the story to do what's going on Ruby seems tense I don't know but I'm going to find out just very on the nose dialogue there's a lot of parentheticals describing how the characters saying the Line This is a screenwriter no no you start to tip into the director's territory I think that AI can help with my my job in conceptual brainstorming playing out scene ideas if you get stuck on a scene but overall I don't think AI can do my job I'm a music producer I'm writing a song for a pop client please write this song and include chords for the guitar the client is heavily influenced by Lana Del Rey it looks like we've gotten a chord structure and some lyrics a typical progression so not too interesting but that's okay so let's make a beat when I work with an artist that's looking for a specific influence I'll think about the BPM that that artist usually goes for [Applause] okay this is pretty good it's a good start another great day in the city I'm feeling lost oh Such a Pity City Lights and heartbeats you walk in and make me complete I like that it's a starting point of course some of the lyrics are super corny I will admit a lot of the time that's how it starts for me right now these programs can't do my job I'm a journalist I'm the reviews editor at wired and I test products for a living so I asked chat gbt to write a review of a product that I've actually written about in the style of my own writing when it comes to electric skateboards there are plenty of options to choose from a little boring this is pulling in data specifically from my review and so it has a lot of similar characteristics and sentences that I might typically use unfortunately I think it's Stripped Away a lot of the personality in the original review it kind of just took a lot of the basic details and spit out this thing that is kind of generic as for things that did right it actually brought out a lot of these specs like the 3000 watt Motors the 26 miles per hour speeds when reading this review it almost sounds like I could have written it by just reading a press release the AI cannot physically handle this product it's not exactly testing the product itself at that point can you really trust where the source is coming from asking chat gbt to write a review based in my voice is definitely weird I'm a circus artist what would I ask the AI to do hmm I don't think there's anything that I can think of that I would have the AI do for me I'm a copywriter McDonald's just went 100 vegan write several taglines so we've got veganize your taste buds today feels like a used car salesman no animals harmed only flavor enhanced I don't ever go to a fast food restaurant and say I really want my flavor enhanced that's not something I'm ever looking for our last one here is wow very short we've got It's Time to Go Green did it run out of um words it typed up some general ideas which actually could help if you were brainstorming and you're like I have nothing at all AI could do my job at a very like a Monday morning no coffee kind of way if you wanted to pay no money and get a bad product sure hey I could do my job I'm a personal trainer please design a fat burning weekly at home workout plan this is definitely a typical plan that someone might want to burn calories with a full body workout you're also doing some type of pull workout that's going to work your back your posterior chain and you're also doing some kind of push so I will say that I like that that it's giving a full range of those types of exercises most people know what a push-up is but do they know how to correctly do a push-up it's saying three sets of eight to ten reps but how much time is in between each set ideally you would want to be able to see the client in person or on a virtual call so that you can see what their form looks like I don't think AI can do my job I'm a DJ I have my radio show coming up I play uplifting disco music for about two hours make a full playlist slash set list for my show it's hitting the Disco on the head for sure I've played a few of these artists on my show before so it's definitely getting pretty close to maybe what a tracklist would be one of these tracks Gotta Keep On by sweet cream I looked it up and there's no trace of it on the internet anywhere where did it get this song from does the song actually exist AI can make a playlist being able to look out into a room and look out into a dance floor and say okay people are tired let me match that energy I don't think that it can do that based on what I've seen I'm a voice actor shouldn't cost the Earth we've created a new line of compostable shoes that are made from sustainable materials I've asked the AI to read this copy let's hear this thing fashion shouldn't cost the Earth we've crew line of compostable hey but not great it's very computer-like it has a strange Cadence and so it ends every sentence like this sustainable which is not the way a human talks it can't change on the Fly is there a joke that I'm supposed to get in the next line it doesn't understand all those things the things that come from like life experiences it's never going to be like the thing that you're going to use for like McDonald's commercials it's going to be like the things that no one really likes to do anyway like 400 hours of instruction manuals or something like that can AI do my job kinda but not really well although it still freaks me out I'm an influencer and I want to know if AI can do my job I want chat gbt to help me with an IG caption that's a picture of me smiling standing at the top of my Matra in Paris Standing On Top of the World or at least on top of mamatra smiley face eyes the view from here is breathtaking the Sakura cord in my back reminding me of the city's Rich history and culture feeling grateful and inspired what a day it has been hashtag grateful this is like really strong but it doesn't necessarily capture how I would speak my audience would know that this is not me probably from the overwhelming amount of emojis I would probably say like hey y'all or like sis that was amazing this AI program cannot do my job but it's very close I'm a chef write a recipe for an Indian restaurant meal include a protein marination it's got definitely a lot of spices that you use in Indian cooking it's actually missing a key component it didn't include yogurt which kind of acts as a binding agent 400 Degrees 20 to 25 minutes for chicken it would probably dry it out overall I would say it's like a nice 8 out of 10 dish I do think a substantial part of being a chef is that creativity and coming up with dishes so in terms of that aspect of the job I think AI comes dangerously close to being able to do my job I'm a translator please translate the opening paragraph of The Sun Also Rises into Korean structural sentence pretty good but there are so many mistakes like if you see the second sentence this is wrong translation in Korean we have casual form and then also respectful form this AI translation use basic written form in first sentence but in the second sentence he used like respect for form it's not consistent AI cannot do my job maybe someday it can do it but so far it's like it made so many mistakes I'm a firefighter there's no way AI can do my job [Music]\"", "length": 3260}

Entities are nodes in KGFarm that represent distinguished\nreal-world objects whose properties are explained by an indepen-\ndent set of features. The entity itself has one or more physical rep-\nresentations. For example, in Figure 3 entity customer can be physi-\ncally represented by the customer\\_id column or the customer\\_phone\ncolumn. In feature discovery and data preparation, entities are\nneeded for feature retrieval and enriching data via join operation.\nFeature view. Feature views are also nodes in KGFarm which\nare an abstraction over a table that provide a logical grouping of\nfeatures describing one, multiple, or no entity. The group of features\nhere is simply the list of physical columns in a table that contains an\nentity. For example, in Figure 3, the table bank\\_stats.csv is abstracted\nas feature view 01 which has a default entity customer described\nby the features credit\\_score, marital, etc. While performing data\npreparation with KGFarm, feature views provide the data scientist\nwith an organized view of all the discovered entities alongside their\nfeatures in the data lake.\nData preparation operations. Data preparation operations are\nnot dedicated nodes but concepts in KGFarm. These are queried\non the fly by exploiting the linking between pipelines, tables, and\ncolumns provided by KGLiDS [8] and abstraction enabled by KG-\nFarm. The pipeline graphs made available by KGLiDS are queried\nto fetch task-specific data preparation operations. These operations\ninclude several transformations provided by sklearn.preprocessing3\nlike StandardScaler, OrdinalEncoder, etc. along with various\ndata cleaning techniques provided by pandas.DataFrame 4 like\ninterpolate, fill, etc. A few examples of these operations can be seen\nin Figure 3 which includes StandardScaler transformation being\napplied to the credit\\_score feature which describes the customer\nentity in feature view 01.\nTo store such a succinct graph in a standardized way, we\n3https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing\n4https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html\n3\ndeveloped an ontology for feature discovery and data preparation:\nthe Farm ontology. The following subsections discuss in detail\nthe Farm ontology followed by the approach adopted by the Farm\nGovernor to automate the discovery of entities, feature views, and\ntheir linking to physical data science artifacts.\n3.1 The Farm Ontology for low-code Data\nPreparation\nThe Farm graph builds on top of the LiDS knowledge graph [ 8]\nprovided by KGLiDS and follows the RDF standard [ 16 ] and Uniform\nResource Identifiers to represent the graph structure, promoting\nshareability and making it easily publishable on the internet. The\nFarm ontology is defined using the Web Ontology Language (OWL\n2) to facilitate interoperability and data sharing on the Web and\nacross platforms. As illustrated in 3, the Farm graph primarily\ncomprises 2 classes: entity and feature view, and 5 object properties\nthat represent the following using unique URIs:\n\u2022 The relationship between a physical ta-\nble and a feature view, represented by\nhttp://kgfarm.com/ontology/hasFeatureView.\n\u2022 The relationship between an entity and a physical table,\nrepresented by http://kgfarm.com/ontology/representedBy.\n\u2022 A feature view with a single entity, represented by\nhttp://kgfarm.com/ontology/hasDefaultEntity.\n\u2022 A feature view with multiple entities represented by\nhttp://kgfarm.com/ontology/hasMultipleEntities.\n\u2022 A feature view with optional physical rep-\nresentation for an entity, represented by\nhttp://kgfarm.com/ontology/hasOptionalEntity.\nThe Farm and LiDS ontology together make it convenient to\nretrieve data preparation operations applied on a specific fea-\nture or an entire feature view. Querying these operations is\ndone in three steps. Firstly, the pipeline graphs presented as\nnamed graphs in KGLiDS are queried to retrieve the columns\non which the sklearn.preprocessing or pandas.DataFrame oper-\nations were used to perform data transformation or cleaning.\nSecondly, using the physical columns retrieved from the first\nstep, tables containing these columns are fetched by utilizing the\nhttp://kglids.org/ontology/isPartOf property offered by the LiDS on-\ntology. Lastly, using the http://kgfarm.com/ontology/hasFeatureView\nproperty, the needed feature view can be fetched which comprises\nall the necessary information concerning the features and their\nentities.\nOnce the Farm graph is hosted across the enterprise, data sci-\nentists can leverage the graph structure to automate many data\npreparation problems by writing SPARQL queries directly or by\naccessing several KGFarm APIs which automate many feature dis-\ncovery and data preparation tasks with minimal or low-coding\nefforts. These APIs query the Farm graph in real-time to empower\nthe data scientist to:\n\u2022 Have a quick look at the entities and feature views that\nexist in the data lake\n\u2022 Update the physical representation of an entity.\n\u2022 Drop feature views directly from the graph.\n\u2022 Enrich data using the physical representation of the entities\nas join keys.\n\u2022 Fetch data transformation and cleaning techniques applied\nto features and tables.\n\u2022 Retrieve features selected by other data scientists in similar\nmachine learning tasks.\nMore details about the KGFarm APIs are provided in 4.\n3.2 Farm graph construction and Entity, Feature\nview automation\nTo abstract entities and feature views in the Farm graph, Gover-\nnor utilizes 1) a machine learning classifier to discover Primary\nkey-Foreign keys and 2) column statistics across datasets of the\ndata lake encapsulated by KGLiDS. The process of the Farm graph\nconstruction consists of two steps as formalized in algorithm 1.\nGeneration of feature view per table: A feature view node is\ngenerated for each table in the data lake. The feature view node\nis then linked to the corresponding physical table by creating a\nhasFeatureView relationship. The feature view nodes are later linked\nto their corresponding entities.\nEntity discovery and linking entity to feature view: To dis-\ncover entities, Governor queries the uniqueness and missing value\ncounts of all the column nodes. If a column has high uniqueness\n(represented by \ud835\udefc in Algorithm 1) of 95% or more and has no missing\nvalues, an entity node is generated and linked to the column node by\ncreating a representedBy relationship. If there is a single column in\na table respecting these conditions, the entity node for the column\nis linked to the feature view which abstracts the table by creating a\nhasDefaultEntity relationship. For tables with multiple columns re-\nspecting these conditions, the column with the highest uniqueness\nand the most number of Primary key-Foreign key pairs is selected\nas the default entity while others are linked to the feature view by\na hasOptionalEntity relationship. A case exemplifying the same can\nbe seen in Figure 3 where for Feature\\_view\\_01, entity customer with\ncustomer\\_id as its physical representation is appointed as the de-\nfault entity and the other with customer\\_phone is appointed as the\noptional entity. This is justified in the above example because the\ncustomer\\_id column will typically have more Primary key-Foreign\nkey relations as compared to the customer\\_phone column. The fea-\nture view nodes of the tables that are left unlinked to any entity are\nthen reiterated as they consist of columns with low uniqueness. In\nthis case, if a table consists of columns with a Primary key-Foreign\nkey relation, an entity node is generated and linked to the column\nnode by creating a representedBy relationship. For tables contain-\ning a single column with Primary key-Foregin key relation, the\nentity node for that column is linked to the feature view which\nabstracts the table by similarly creating a hasDefaultEntity relation-\nship. However, tables containing multiple columns with Primary\nkey-Foreign key relations are linked to the corresponding feature\nview by creating a hasMultipleEntities relationship. An example of\nsuch cases can also be seen in figure 3 where the feature\\_view\\_02\nis linked to two entities, entity driver represented by the driver\\_id\ncolumn and the entity passenger represented by the passenger\\_id\ncolumn which belongs to the rides.csv table. The tables with the\nfeature view nodes that are still left unmapped are treated as feature\nviews with no entity as they do not contain any column with high\nuniqueness or Primary key-Foreign key relations.\n\n3.3 Primary key-Foreign key discovery\nOur quest to find the entity associated with a table in a dataset\nhighlights the need to recognize Primary key-Foreign key pairs\nwithin the dataset. Primary key-foreign key extraction is valuable\nin dataset with no column uniqueness as well as datasets with\nmultiple columns with high uniqueness. In cases where no column\nin the table is unique, the primary key of the table is the most\nprobable candidate to be the physical representation of the entity.\nIn cases where there are multiple columns with a high uniqueness,\nthe frequency with which a column is referenced as a foreign key\nin other datasets serves as a tie breaker to identify the column\nrepresenting the entity, with the most referred column being the\nmost probable candidate.\nOverview: Given that all primary key-foreign key pairs have a\nhigh degree of content similarity (CS), a list of pairs with content\nsimilarity was compiled by querying KGLiDS [ 8]. Content similar-\nity was used to obtain the short list of primary key-foreign key\ncandidates as it is lightweight and is more likely to be extracted by\nprofilers compared to Inclusion Dependencies (IND) which is the\nmethod used it the current state of the art primary key-foreign key\nextractor [18]. A binary classification algorithm was then used to\nclassify the pairs as primary key-foreign key pairs or non-primary\nkey-foreign key pairs. Nine features were extracted from both the\ndatasets and the knowledge graph and were used to train the data.\nThe data was undersampled using a 1:3 ratio and the model was\ntrained using a 5 fold Cross validation with sklearn\u2019s naive-bayes,\nrandom forest and SVC classifiers.\nFeatures: Six of the nine features used to train the model were\nobtained by querying KGLiDS [ 8 ], resulting in a more rapid feature\nextraction process. These features and their implementations can\nbe found in Table 1.\nF1: Distinct Dependent Values. The predicate\ndata:hasDistinctValueCount from the graph was used to\nobtain this feature.\nF2: Coverage. The coverage is defined by the similarity of the\nprimary key and foreign key, and is defined by the graph predicate\ncalled data:hasDeepEmbeddingContentSimilarity.\nF3: Dependant and Referenced. This feature is describes as the\nnumber of times that a foreign key value is used as a primary key\nvalue. We used the column names to determine how many times in\nthe list of pairs was a column designated as a foreign key column\nused as a primary key column.\nF4: Multidependant. This feature is describes as the number of\ntimes that a foreign key value is used as a foreign key value in other\ncolumns. We used the column names to determine how many times\nin the list of pairs was a column designated as a foreign key column\nused as a foreign key column in other tables.\nF5: MultiReferenced. This feature is described as the number of\ntimes that a primary key value is used as a primary key value in\nother columns. We used the column names to determine how many\ntimes in the list of pairs was a column designated as a primary key\ncolumn used as a primary key column in other tables.\n5\nTable 1: Features and their implementations\nID Name Description\nF1 Distinct Dependent Values Counts the number of distinct values in each column\nF2 Coverage The percentage of content similarity between column A and B\nF3 Dependent and Referenced How often a the column name of foreign key candidate is the same as the column name\nof primary key candidate\nF4 MultiDependent How often a the column name of foreign key candidate is the same as the column name\nof foreign key candidate\nF5 MultiReferenced How often a the column name of primary key candidate is the same as the column\nname of foreign key candidate\nF6 Column Name Column names are similar\nF8 Out of Range Columns that have the same maximum and minimum values\nF9 Typical Name Suffix The column name has the suffix \"id\", \"num\" or \"key\"\nF10 Table Size Ratio The ratio of the number of rows in the foreign key column candidate to the number of\nrows in the primary key column candidate\nF6: Column name. This feature describes the level of similar-\nity between column names which is done using the predicate\ndata:hasSemanticSimilarity from the graph\nF8: Out of range. The feature calculates the percentage of rows in\nthe primary key column (s(B)) that are within the range of values\nin the suggested foreign key column (s(A)). The feature produces 1\nif the maximum value in the primary key column is equal to the\nmaximum value of the foreign key and the minimum value of the\nprimary key is equal to the minimum value of the foreign key. The\nmaximum and minimum values for each column can be extracted\nusing the data:hasMaxValue and data:hasMinValue predicates of\nthe graph.\nF9: Typical suffix name. This feature would check whether the\nforeign key column name contained the suffix \u2019id\u2019, \u2019key\u2019 or \u2019num\u2019.\n[18]\nF10: Table size ration. This feature calculates the ratio of the\nnumber of rows in the foreign key column to the number of\nrows in the primary key column using the graph predicate\ndata:hasTotalValueCount.", "length": 3520}

{"prompt": "ill start by providing information of the fresh earth token, lets refernce this as FET; and this will be uploaded in a few uploads; Tokennomics\n\nToken name and symbol: \n\nFresh Earth Token (FET)\n\nToken Overview\u00a0\n\nThe Fresh Earth Token (FET) is the backbone of the Fresh Earth ecosystem, serving as a means to pull the future impact of regenerative projects to the present to fund the projects; and also as the primary means of incentivizing participation and engagement of stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, and investors. \n\nThe Fresh Earth token is designed to contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable and regenerative food system, and address the pressing issues of climate change and environmental degradation in the agricultural industry. It incentivizes regenerative agricultural practices and enables investment in sustainable agrifood projects by creating a token economy that rewards farmers, consumers, and impact investors for their participation in the regenerative agricultural ecosystem. \n\nThe Fresh Earth Token is more than just a financial instrument; it is a tool for change. It gives individuals and businesses choice and tools to actively participate in the transition to a more sustainable, healthy and regenerative food system, ensuring that the ecosystem is moving towards its goal of regenerating land and promoting sustainable practices, while also providing a store of value and an opportunity for profit. \n\nToken Structure\n\nThe token represents fractional ownership of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that facilitates the food ecosystem business. It is used to access and participate in the Fresh Earth ecosystem, to make decisions in the governance of the ecosystem and to serve within the community of regenerative farmers, consumers, and impact investors. \n\nThe token operates through a set of algorithms that are designed to generate verifiable impact within the ecosystem. These algorithms take into account the actions and participation of all stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, and investors, in order to ensure that the ecosystem is moving towards its goal of regenerating land and promoting sustainable practices.\n\nThe underlying value of the Fresh Earth Token is derived from the worth of the stakeholder-owned Fresh Earth ecosystem, along with the valuation and monetisation of the impacts of regenerative projects. The value of the ecosystem is determined by the stakeholders, while the impact of regenerative projects is measured by key performance indicators (KPIs) such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density. These KPIs provide verified measurements of impact that can be leveraged to secure external funding from government schemes and investorsI. Introduction\n\nToken Classification\n\nThe Fresh Earth Token is a unique combination of several different token archetypes, including utility, governance, community, asset-backed, and stablecoin. \n\nUtility: the token's ability to facilitate communication and collaboration between farmers, investors, government bodies, and other stakeholders in the regenerative agriculture ecosystem makes it a powerful tool for coordinating efforts and tracking progress within the ecosystem. \n\nGovernance: The token's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structure allows for transparent and democratic decision-making processes, further promoting coordination among ecosystem actors.\n\nCommunity: The above combined form the basis for a strong community archetype token.\n\nAsset based: The Fresh Earth Token is a store of value that can be held by stakeholders as a liquid financial reservoir, and may retain value and purchasing power over time. \n\nStable coin: The value of the Fresh Earth Token is linked to the success of the ecosystem and the impact of regenerative projects, allowing for a stable value of the token.\n\nIn Token Classification, the Fresh Earth Token is a Utility Token that functions as a governance token, and is structured as a community token and an asset-backed token.\n\nUnderlying Value of the Fresh Earth Token is based on fractional ownership, impact validation and an economic engine that is built into the ecosystem to drive investment and impact. Assets includes real-world assets, key performance indicators, and access and participation that are all linked to the ecosystem's ability to promote sustainable practices and address the pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security. \n\nShare-Like value includes fractional ownership, rights and privileges, and impact leverage, which all contribute to the ecosystem's ability to internalize the costs of the food system and redistribute the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards, creating an economic engine for the ecosystem.\n\nNetwork Value is built on trust and utility, supply and demand, and network growth, all of which are designed to create a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem's classification can be broken down into several key areas.\n\nA. Morphological Domain\n\nToken Form: The Fresh Earth Token is a digital token that is built on the Hashgraph HTS (Hedera Hashgraph Token Service) platform, using Guardian nodes from the Hedera network. This allows for a secure and efficient token form that can be easily integrated into the Fresh Earth ecosystem.\n\nToken Function: The Fresh Earth Token serves several functions within the ecosystem, including as fractional ownership, a means of access, a medium of exchange, a governance tool, and a store of value. These functions are facilitated by its integration with the Hashgraph HTS platform and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structure.\n\nToken Structure: The Fresh Earth Token is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business. It is governed by a set of smart contracts and is controlled by token holders. The Fresh Earth Token is structured as a utility token, with a finite supply that is determined by the ecosystem's needs and growth. The token is also designed to be divisible, which allows for fractional ownership and increased accessibility within the ecosystem.\n\nToken Relationship: The Fresh Earth Token has a symbiotic relationships with regenerated land and land and health of people, and to the growing value of those assets and others within the Fresh Earth ecosystem. The token is also integrated with the Hashgraph HTS platform, which allows for efficient and secure transactions within the ecosystem, further contributing to its value and utility.\n\nB. Pseudo-Archetypes\n\nUtility Token: The Fresh Earth token serves as a utility token, allowing holders to access and participate in the Fresh Earth ecosystem\u2019s products, services, knowledge base and rewards system. It is also a medium of exchange, and a store of value.\n\nGovernance Token: The Fresh Earth Token is governed by a set of smart contracts and is controlled by token holders, allowing for decentralized decision-making within the ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Token: The Fresh Earth Token is a digital collaborative community that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume. This includes the ability to participate in Fresh Earth Projects, advocacy groups, Buying Groups and Research Groups. \n\nAsset-Backed Token: The Fresh Earth Token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem, and is valued based on the assets of the ecosystem and the impact of regenerative projects. with its underlying value tied to the value of real-world assets such as the monetizable value of carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density. These assets are measured by key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide verified measurements of impact, that can be leveraged to secure external funding from government schemes such as carbon trading. They enable the token to access and participate in multiple markets, such as carbon offsetting, pay for performance, impact investing, community-based financing, regenerative agriculture financing, water rights trading, biodiversity offsets, ecosystem services markets, conservation easements, benefit-sharing agreements, and community land, and not least the monetizable value of the massive data accumulation\n\nStablecoin: As an Assets Based Fractional Ownership Token, the Fresh Earth Token is linked to the assets mentioned above. The asset values can be expanded on multiple fronts, by growth of the network, growth of the of tradable values such as carbon credits, and growth in the diversity of values such as water retention, biodiversity and animal welfare as Fresh Earth and society collaborate to value these. Therefore Fresh Earth will have the asset to token ratio to buyback tokens if needed to maintain the value, which fundamentally should always be increasing, as regrnerataed land is a finite source of ever increasing value.\n\nC. Underlying Value\n\nFractional Ownership: The Fresh Earth Token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem, allowing for investment in the ecosystem without having to purchase the entire ecosystem.\n\nImpact Validation: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes a validation system that uses data to measure and validate the impact of regenerative practices, ensuring that the ecosystem is having a positive impact on the environment and society.\n\nEconomic Engine: The Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to internalize the costs of the food system and redistribute the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards, creating an economic engine for the ecosystem.\n\nD. Asset-Based\n\nReal-World Assets: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes real-world assets such as carbon credits, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density. Also Fresh Earth will own or have JV and licensing relationships with regenerative farming and production systems. See also above under Assets-Based Token\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs): The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes IP such as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), metrics used to measure and verify the impact of the Fresh Earth ecosystem's projects. \n\nAccess and Participation: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes a B2B and B2C marketplace, a digital collaborative community, and a rewards system, allowing for access and participation in the ecosystem, and fractional ownership These KPIs provide verified measurements of impact that can be leveraged to secure external funding from various markets.\n\nE. Network Value\n\nTrust and Utility: The Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to create a transparent and verifiable impact for sustainable agrifood projects, thus building trust and utility. This trust is established through the use of blockchain technology, which provides a secure and decentralized platform for the ecosystem to operate on. The utility of the Fresh Earth Token lies in every aspect of the tolen, including its ability to represent fractional ownership of the ecosystem, the empowerment of individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources, their health, and participate in a transformed food system, and the token;s ability to incentivise regenerative behaviour through its reward system.\n\nSupply and Demand: The Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to balance the supply and demand for regenerative food products through its B2B and B2C marketplaces. By connecting regenerative farmers with businesses and consumers, the ecosystem aims to increase the supply of regenerative food products and create a greater demand for them. Additionally, the ecosystem's rewards system aims to incentivize participation and engagement, which in turn drives the demand for the Fresh Earth Token.\n\nNetwork Growth: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes several networks including B2C, B2B, Digital Communities of both consumers and experts, farm and supplier networks, health practitioners etc. The networks are visible to each other and mutually reinforcing. The intermeshing components of the ecosystem are designed to promote network growth through its various incentive drivers, such as the rewards system and the validation system. As more individuals and businesses participate in the ecosystem, the network becomes more attractive, accelerating growth of the network (Metcalfe's Law.) and the value of the Fresh Earth Token. This empowers the ecosystem's impact on the environment and society. Additionally, the ecosystem's focus on regenerative agriculture practices and community-based food system promotes a positive feedback loop, where the success of the ecosystem drives more investment and greater impact, leading to greater value for token holders.

{"prompt": "please stand corrected, the FET is: Token Classification\nThe Fresh Earth Token is a unique combination of several different token archetypes, including utility, governance, community, asset-backed, and stablecoin. \n\nUtility: the token's ability to facilitate communication and collaboration between farmers, investors, government bodies, and other stakeholders in the regenerative agriculture ecosystem makes it a powerful tool for coordinating efforts and tracking progress within the ecosystem. \n\nGovernance: The token's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structure allows for transparent and democratic decision-making processes, further promoting coordination among ecosystem actors.\n\nCommunity: The above combined form the basis for a strong community archetype token.\n\nAsset based: The Fresh Earth Token is a store of value that can be held by stakeholders as a liquid financial reservoir, and may retain value and purchasing power over time. \n\nStable coin: The value of the Fresh Earth Token is linked to the success of the ecosystem and the impact of regenerative projects, allowing for a stable value of the token.\n\nIn Token Classification, the Fresh Earth Token is a Utility Token that functions as a governance token, and is structured as a community token and an asset-backed token.\n\nUnderlying Value of the Fresh Earth Token is based on fractional ownership, impact validation and an economic engine that is built into the ecosystem to drive investment and impact. Assets includes real-world assets, key performance indicators, and access and participation that are all linked to the ecosystem's ability to promote sustainable practices and address the pressing issues of climate change, health, and food security. \n\nShare-Like value includes fractional ownership, rights and privileges, and impact leverage, which all contribute to the ecosystem's ability to internalize the costs of the food system and redistribute the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards, creating an economic engine for the ecosystem.\n\nNetwork Value is built on trust and utility, supply and demand, and network growth, all of which are designed to create a comprehensive, community-based food system that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume.\n\nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem's classification can be broken down into several key areas.\n\nA. Morphological Domain\n\nToken Form: The Fresh Earth Token is a digital token that is built on the Hashgraph HTS (Hedera Hashgraph Token Service) platform, using Guardian nodes from the Hedera network. This allows for a secure and efficient token form that can be easily integrated into the Fresh Earth ecosystem.\n\nToken Function: The Fresh Earth Token serves several functions within the ecosystem, including as fractional ownership, a means of access, a medium of exchange, a governance tool, and a store of value. These functions are facilitated by its integration with the Hashgraph HTS platform and the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance structure.\n\nToken Structure: The Fresh Earth Token is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the food ecosystem business. It is governed by a set of smart contracts and is controlled by token holders. The Fresh Earth Token is structured as a utility token, with a finite supply that is determined by the ecosystem's needs and growth. The token is also designed to be divisible, which allows for fractional ownership and increased accessibility within the ecosystem.\n\nToken Relationship: The Fresh Earth Token has a symbiotic relationships with regenerated land and land and health of people, and to the growing value of those assets and others within the Fresh Earth ecosystem. The token is also integrated with the Hashgraph HTS platform, which allows for efficient and secure transactions within the ecosystem, further contributing to its value and utility.\n\nB. Pseudo-Archetypes\n\nUtility Token: The Fresh Earth token serves as a utility token, allowing holders to access and participate in the Fresh Earth ecosystem\u2019s products, services, knowledge base and rewards system. It is also a medium of exchange, and a store of value.\n\nGovernance Token: The Fresh Earth Token is governed by a set of smart contracts and is controlled by token holders, allowing for decentralized decision-making within the ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Token: The Fresh Earth Token is a digital collaborative community that empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources and improve the quality and nutritional density of the food they consume. This includes the ability to participate in Fresh Earth Projects, advocacy groups, Buying Groups and Research Groups. \n\nAsset-Backed Token: The Fresh Earth Token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem, and is valued based on the assets of the ecosystem and the impact of regenerative projects. with its underlying value tied to the value of real-world assets such as the monetizable value of carbon sequestration, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density. These assets are measured by key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide verified measurements of impact, that can be leveraged to secure external funding from government schemes such as carbon trading. They enable the token to access and participate in multiple markets, such as carbon offsetting, pay for performance, impact investing, community-based financing, regenerative agriculture financing, water rights trading, biodiversity offsets, ecosystem services markets, conservation easements, benefit-sharing agreements, and community land, and not least the monetizable value of the massive data accumulation\n\nStablecoin: As an Assets Based Fractional Ownership Token, the Fresh Earth Token is linked to the assets mentioned above. The asset values can be expanded on multiple fronts, by growth of the network, growth of the of tradable values such as carbon credits, and growth in the diversity of values such as water retention, biodiversity and animal welfare as Fresh Earth and society collaborate to value these. Therefore Fresh Earth will have the asset to token ratio to buyback tokens if needed to maintain the value, which fundamentally should always be increasing, as regrnerataed land is a finite source of ever increasing value.\n\nC. Underlying Value\n\nFractional Ownership: The Fresh Earth Token represents fractional ownership of the ecosystem, allowing for investment in the ecosystem without having to purchase the entire ecosystem.\n\nImpact Validation: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes a validation system that uses data to measure and validate the impact of regenerative practices, ensuring that the ecosystem is having a positive impact on the environment and society.\n\nEconomic Engine: The Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to internalize the costs of the food system and redistribute the money back into the ecosystem through token sales and rewards, creating an economic engine for the ecosystem.\n\nD. Asset-Based\n\nReal-World Assets: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes real-world assets such as carbon credits, biodiversity, water retention, and food nutritional density. Also Fresh Earth will own or have JV and licensing relationships with regenerative farming and production systems. See also above under Assets-Based Token\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs): The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes IP such as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), metrics used to measure and verify the impact of the Fresh Earth ecosystem's projects. \n\nAccess and Participation: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes a B2B and B2C marketplace, a digital collaborative community, and a rewards system, allowing for access and participation in the ecosystem, and fractional ownership These KPIs provide verified measurements of impact that can be leveraged to secure external funding from various markets.\n\nE. Network Value\n\nTrust and Utility: The Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to create a transparent and verifiable impact for sustainable agrifood projects, thus building trust and utility. This trust is established through the use of blockchain technology, which provides a secure and decentralized platform for the ecosystem to operate on. The utility of the Fresh Earth Token lies in every aspect of the tolen, including its ability to represent fractional ownership of the ecosystem, the empowerment of individuals and businesses to take control of their food sources, their health, and participate in a transformed food system, and the token;s ability to incentivise regenerative behaviour through its reward system.\n\nSupply and Demand: The Fresh Earth ecosystem aims to balance the supply and demand for regenerative food products through its B2B and B2C marketplaces. By connecting regenerative farmers with businesses and consumers, the ecosystem aims to increase the supply of regenerative food products and create a greater demand for them. Additionally, the ecosystem's rewards system aims to incentivize participation and engagement, which in turn drives the demand for the Fresh Earth Token.\n\nNetwork Growth: The Fresh Earth ecosystem includes several networks including B2C, B2B, Digital Communities of both consumers and experts, farm and supplier networks, health practitioners etc. The networks are visible to each other and mutually reinforcing. The intermeshing components of the ecosystem are designed to promote network growth through its various incentive drivers, such as the rewards system and the validation system. As more individuals and businesses participate in the ecosystem, the network becomes more attractive, accelerating growth of the network (Metcalfe's Law.) and the value of the Fresh Earth Token. This empowers the ecosystem's impact on the environment and society. Additionally, the ecosystem's focus on regenerative agriculture practices and community-based food system promotes a positive feedback loop, where the success of the ecosystem drives more investment and greater impact, leading to greater value for token holders. Additionally, Fresh Earth consumers are incentivized and rewarded for their participation in the ecosystem, further driving network growth and increasing the value of the token.\n\nF.

These external funds are redistributed back to stakeholders in the form of rewards for participation, further adding value to the token.\n\nIncentive Enablers\nIncentive enablers are features or attributes of the token that facilitate the alignment of incentives between different participants. Fresh Earth tokens provide the following rights that enable stakeholders to participate in the ecosystem and benefit from its growth and success, amongst others:.\n\nRight to use: Fresh Earth tokens may be used to access services and content within the ecosystem, such as access to regenerative farming practices and regeneratively grown food products.\n\nRight to vote: Fresh Earth tokens may be used as a requirement for stakeholders to influence the decision-making of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages the Fresh Earth ecosystem.\n\nUnit of account: Fresh Earth tokens may be used to measure the value of services, assets, labor and liabilities within the ecosystem.\n\nMedium of exchange: Fresh Earth tokens may be used as a medium of exchange to trade goods or services within the ecosystem.\n\nStore of value: Fresh Earth tokens may be held by stakeholders as a liquid financial reservoir, and may retain value and purchasing power over time.\n\nIncentive Drivers \nThe Fresh Earth ecosystem is designed to incentivize participation and engagement through a variety of different Incentive Drivers. In addition to the enablers, the Fresh Earth token also serves as a key driver for participation and engagement in the ecosystem. These include:\n\nGet Access: token grants access to services and content within the ecosystem\n\nGet Discount: token holders access discounts on services and content available within the ecosystem\n\nGet Revenue: allows actors within the ecosystem to monetize their participation\n\nGet Reward: token holders are rewarded for actions that contribute to the ecosystem's success and growth, such as adopting regenerative practices and registering land on the platform\n\nParticipate in Governance: token holders can use their tokens to shape the ecosystem's rules and decisions through decentralized governance\n\nAppreciation Potential, which allows token holders to benefit from the ecosystem's success or the uplift in value of the token, and get a share of it by holding, staking or selling tokens\n\nToken use cases and utility\nFresh Earth Tokens will have a number of key use cases and utilities within the Fresh Earth ecosystem. Firstly, they will be used as a means of access to the services and content provided within the ecosystem, such as marketplaces for regeneratively produced food and resources for regenerative farmers. Secondly, they will be used as a means of participation in the governance of the ecosystem, allowing token holders to vote on key decisions and proposals. Thirdly, they will serve as a unit of account and medium of exchange within the ecosystem, allowing for the measurement and intermediation of economic transactions. Finally, they will act as a store of value, with their value being tied to the success and growth of the ecosystem.", "length": 3362}
{"prompt": "Provide bullet points of the essential details in the following meeting transcript:\n\nMishka Thomas\nWhat what do you think about that? The team overview series that I mentioned in my voice message a few weeks back? Yeah,\n\nJeanette 14:44\nI think yeah, I think that's great. You know, I but I think that like, with everything that's going on, like teams are extremely like, you know, teams are stretched thin. Everybody's busy. Everybody's draft. It has to be like something, you know, given like pretty far in advance. Yeah. So, like, you know, like if you were going to ask Michael to do I know you weren't on the you know, they the fireside have the kickoff or whatever, last week, but one of the questions that came up was like, Oh, it was really helpful to see like revenue numbers from last year but can you explain to us like our different contracts and how those work and you know, and stuff like that like, but if you were going to if we were going to ask Michael to do like you know, a readout of something like that, or team overview or whatever, like, you know, it would have to be like, not in the beginning of the month that would, you know, like it should be like, maybe like the third week of the month when we're kind of in between close and he should have a month to be able to prepare that like, you don't I mean, so. Like, it can't be like a last minute like, Hey, does engineering want to do an overview today? So I think that, like things are going to come up that we're going to need to take the slot for like, you know, like major announcements or a pivot or something like that. But we should have, like teams prepared to do like these kinds of overviews, but with, you know, like, like far out in advance.\n\nMishka Thomas 16:20\nYeah. And I actually want to leave it up to them to like, determine like, what time period would be best. So based on what they're currently working on, if they think like six weeks from now, that Thursday, would be like good for for their team. Then. Like, like I mentioned, like, I'd be sourcing all of the content. All of these I want to be like, relatively far in advance, like planned out relatively far in advance and I just be connecting with whoever like, heads that that department sending out the deck in advance so they know like what to expect. But they are going to be like guiding a lot of the timeline. And yeah, if there's anything that we need to do in between those, like we could plug those in wherever needed. And also the the RMD today series, I think it would be nice to just do like once per quarter just going over things like company's main areas of focus, currently reiterating strategy, like things of that nature. And again, we want to have these like, planned out relatively far in advance. The only thing that we're not going to be able to, like have planned is just the main areas of focus, because, you know, that's gonna be different like January then it would be like March so, but I do think it would be helpful to do those just to make sure that like, everyone in the company knows what's going on. So like a trickle down from like, you know, like things that would be discussed in leadership, Lt. ELT that folks should be privy to Yeah, I think that will be helpful for everyone.\n\nJeanette 18:39\nYeah, yeah. And as long as they're planned out in advance, so we're never sourcing content the week of we're not canceling last minute and stuff like that. Okay, awesome. Like they should be like intentional meetings, not just on the calendar for whatever. Yeah. Those also, another thing that you should think about is like, the G and a scrum. I don't feel like it like we changed the Kaden, you know, so it's, it's occurring, you know, only once a week as opposed to multiple times a week we did a little bit longer, but it's not really any different. Like, it still feels like an arbitrary like just people showing up what they're working on like you know, I thought we were going to start making those a little more intentional as well, and they don't really feel you know, intentional. They're not run by anyone. Like they're kind of just the same thing just less frequently.\n\nMishka Thomas 19:49\nNext week's next week's is, I think, going to be my first one in a good little minute. Okay, so I'll just see what everyone has been doing at next week's and then the following week, I think that would be the 13th I can, like, propose whatever changes I think we we should make.\n\nJeanette 20:23\nWell, it's the same thing, but it's always been it's literally people getting on and saying what like they're working on that week what they worked on the last week, you know, no roadblocks that said like, I don't, I mean, I don't think you need to like see another GNA scrum in order to like propose something that would be more intentional or more, you know, a better use of people's time. It's literally the same thing. It's always been there is no difference.\n\nMishka Thomas 20:51\nOkay, so folks are just coming on and just seeing like, just like what they're currently working on, are they going over like, high level? Any like, projects that they're currently like taking on? Is there any like discussion around things that they need from like, others, not only in GNA, but like across?\n\nJeanette 21:22\nI mean, like, well, so we had that. We had the workshop, and then we kind of talked about like, you know, we should change these these should be more intentional. The only thing that we changed was how often they are I mean, even you know, the last couple that you joined, it was the same thing as it always was, you know, like just a little less granular because it's not like here's what I'm working on today. And here's what I did like Friday. It's, you know, like a little bit more high level, but I don't know that that like, you know, there should there should be some structure to it. Like, only talk about Roblox or only, you know, like talk about like, A, B or C, like we don't need to know everything that you're working on today. Like, you know what I mean? Like there was just never like, there just hasn't been any structure added to it and no one's been like they haven't been run. They just in my opinion, I don't feel like they've changed at all and, like, except just changing how often they happen.\n\nMishka Thomas 22:24\nOkay, I'll do some brainstorming around that. And think about Yeah, we could make those more intentional going forward. Got it. Joke. And just over the past two weeks, like I just wanted to get an idea. Is there anything like that happened that I need to know about? Any changes around strategy, just anything that I might have missed that it would be helpful? To know?\n\nJeanette 23:06\nI don't think so. We did. So for team I mean, nothing really happened the week of Team week because it was team week. And we kind of like we did you know a kickoff on on Tuesday. Which was mostly talking about like what was going to happen during team week and it was like a mini all hands with like, anniversaries and birthdays and and stuff like that and then But then we like we went into like a look back in 2022. Like, you know, revenue volume, clinical impact, stuff like that. And then we did a look forward. And mostly what that was, was Carlos reiterating the growth strategy and the changes there and the premier accounts and like, you know, like you saw that with leadership. I think you saw it with all team thanks. So that shouldn't be new. And then we had individual team, like planning meetings. So like there was like, meetings to discuss how we're going to drive engagement and products. Through like Iara and fermitas. And you know, like, ever side and with the other one health first and you know, so like account planning meetings, a lot of talk about, you know, hitting numbers and volume so nothing really different there. And then GNA showed everybody the internet. I think, you know, you could probably get Brittany to take you through that yesterday. And then. Yes, and the Internet and then Christy kind of just recap the growth strategy and what we talked about at the at the you know, at the account planning meetings, and that was pretty much it. So, no, like real change in strategy or anything. I think it's it was just a lot of reiteration of things that we've already been, you know, talking about, I think they're recorded also.\n\nMishka Thomas 25:18\nThat's what I was gonna ask you so\n\nJeanette 25:20\nthey're all verge like everything had people like, you know, on the line as well. So they should be recorded, so you could probably ask Amelia, I have I know. Yeah. For all the recordings and you can go and listen to those but nothing really. You know, you know at a company level,\n\nMishka Thomas 25:43\nokay, there. So the recording for the BH growth strategy session. I wasn't sure if that was something that they did. Just with the BH team. Is that something that I should go back and watch?\n\nJeanette 26:00\nI was, I wasn't in that I have no idea.\n\nMishka Thomas 26:02\nOkay. Okay, I'll check it out and see. Okay. That was everything. That was everything that I had. And for today is leadership team meeting. I'll see Pavi I don't know if you saw the the reply that Pavi sent through. But she said Would it make sense to do the oshs update this week or wait? Until\n\nJeanette 26:44\nYeah, I saw that. And Carlos said it's fine either way, because the meeting on Thursday will be the second half of the year. So I'm just gonna let Povey I'm gonna I'm gonna run today's because I've been talking to everybody about the agenda and then also going forward. I think, at least for a little while. I want to be involved in setting the agenda. Just because I want to make sure that we are choosing the most intentional things to put on on the agenda. You know, someone's just like, oh, I you know, I want to do a read out on this. If it's not, like, you know, something that is going to be, you know, worth, like all of leadership's time or if it's something that can be combined with something else like I just I want to make sure that you know, everything is really intentional in these conversations.\n\nMishka Thomas 27:38\nGot it. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, awesome. Yep. Everything for me. Was there. Anything on your end?\n\nJeanette 27:50\nNo, just the other you know, the other thing is, is just, you know, so so that I understand for there's like, your back full time, there's no restriction.\n\nMishka Thomas 28:01\nUm, yeah, I'm like, like I put in the email like just to be fully transparent. Like, I'm, I'm not like 100% You know, back to normal. I honestly don't know when that's going to be which is kind of frustrating. But I am, like, well enough to where I can be back to work full time. And like, like I outlined there, like, I'll just do like what I need to do without having it be like disruptive. So if I have to like step away from anything, I'll just step away pop in my air pods. So I can still participate in everything. Just not being in front of the screen all day, like I usually would be but it's, I'm, I'm going to do my best to operate in a way where it's not disruptive to anything.\n\nJeanette 29:02\nOkay, so if, if they're like, I, I just want to know, in advance, like if you're supposed to be running a meeting, and you're not going to be able to be on camera, or you're not going to be able to fully do that. Like I just I need to know, like, you know, nautical last minute. Yeah, I can get you covered. And, you know, I think that if you find that it's starting to, you know, be you know, kind of like what it was before you went out on leave where you know, you're working on something and then you have to go offline for the rest of the day or for hours and it's kind of like this start stop and I don't know where you left off and where I need to cover and everything like that. I think that we should, like call it right, like, you know right away and have a conversation. I don't want it to get to the point where, you know, it's just like it's frustrating. And you're getting worse and your health is suffering.\n\nMishka Thomas 30:02\nYeah, definitely. I am way better than I was then. Like, I'm not having my headaches aren't nearly as bad. Like, yeah, so that that shouldn't happen. I don't know if I had put it in the email but I did let Laura know. If there are any changes, I will let you guys know immediately. But um, right now, I am significantly better. So there there shouldn't be a need for that. But if there is then I will update you guys immediately.\n\nJeanette 30:42\nOkay, perfect. Yeah. Sounds good. All right. Glad to have you back.\n\nMishka Thomas 30:47\nYes. I'm glad to be back.\n\nJeanette 30:50\nAll right. All right. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.", "length": 3396}

{"prompt": "Summarize the following.\nTitle: \"(88) 'Prometheus Rising' by Robert Anton Wilson - Chapter 7, with Alley Wurds @ VR Mystery School - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"[Music] uh i'm bubble also known as ali words i have a bachelor's degree in philosophy and i've worked with and written about prometheus rising over the past five years last week we read chapter six the time binding semantic circuit if you missed it look it up on our youtube channel this session will also be recorded and uploaded so the exercises last time did anyone have a chance to try any of that i tried one um incidentally someone left a uh i came across a dvd of a movie called gods not dead and it is a christian film about an atheist professor who does not act like any philosophy professor i ever had um who's like violently atheist and he forces all the students on the first day of class to write like god is dead and this one kid he refuses um because he's like a devout christian and then it's like i didn't get all the way through it because of just like i've been busy lately but he uh it's about his relationship with god and i think the atheist professor at the end probably converts to christianity because he realizes maybe he should soften up a little bit but um so i'm not an atheist myself but it is definitely not the world view that i'm from it's from people that are like violently anti-philosophy whoever wrote that film uh it was very ignorant of philosophy and philosophers and like their arguments for the existence or not arguing for the existence of god just like had no connection with the history of theology like they could have just dropped in kierkegaard and resolved the whole thing so yeah i'm rambling now that's interesting but uh yeah it's good to find like movies are really easy you can find movies that support ideologies that you don't agree with um a good thing to look at that is of historical value is there a lot of um early ussr um cinema that were like avant-garde like they invented the montage so like you learn about the history of film but you also see how they're using it to like glorify the working class um and you can see a very different kind of dialectic good stuff um i had a question you know when i was doing this exercise i did get a short chance for it i find it quite hard to really have something of a new insight i was wondering if you had any like aha moments about this experience that you thought are interesting to share um not with that movie uh so one of the philosophers related to negentropy and accelerationism there's a whole movement now called accelerationism is nick land who is himself or maybe was an occultist he did stuff where he created a decimal based kabbalah system like starting with zero through nine called the pneumogram and it was like also based on like cthulhu and lovecraftian stuff but uh he has moved to china and i'm not totally up to date on him but his works at the very least are used by a lot of accelerationist they call themselves the dark enlightenment philosophers a lot of them are very fascist and racist and there are like subreddits where you can read um where they like post oh is it like the daily mold bug or something i don't keep up with it but uh and they like find articles that support their racist ideas and then they comment about it and it's interesting to see these people i actually read the subreddit for like a month or two like not every day and there were times where i could really feel the emotion and the hurt that some of these people had how threatened they felt and a lot of it is about themselves uh feeling threatened and that's like threatening their second circuit and even their their first circuit especially with the uh rioting that has happened in america this year there there were some telegram groups that i was watching where uh i was looking at both black lives matter groups and also reactionary groups just to compare the intel they were sharing was interesting and yeah it can be an experience watching like the black lives matter riots as they were happening on telegram yeah yeah i did the two sometimes you really feel definitely the different echo chambers and they touch uh here and there sometimes you know like uh even you'll see instances where the same info bit again it gets explained differently in these different groups and exactly each will use it uh just the same way as the other group is to um well fuel the fire of their cause and so on yeah i guess i stumbled yeah exactly like accidentally into this group or a couple threads that had to do with this new meme format which is um again you know relating a lot of mysticism and and philosophy ancient history you know things that are very dear to me and inspire me to do great you know people are putting this together and and sewing it into some kind of a you know ethnic supreme narrative and that's you know it's kind of quite shocking for me to see so then i figured hey let's stick around for a little bit and take a look because well i was going to go try anyway for the exercise but then to see again you know what is inspiring me to open my heart and develop things like empathy and altruism for other people it's fuel on the fire of their um like ethno nationalism and those kind of things it's it's really crazy to think about that i guess that was my my primary insight from from the exercise yeah that's what it was for me really is just having empathy and especially in the more extreme groups that um that you either agree with or you don't um they're all people and a lot of them in the more extreme groups are really afraid is what i've seen in the looking at like the more racist type groups and um you know they they deserve empathy even like anyone everyone does and if you can actually feel their fear even if you come to the conclusion that's irrational i think that that is a valuable human experience the time binding dialectic acceleration and deceleration in the dialectic between nature and the socially constructed world the human organism is transformed in this dialectic man produces reality and thereby produces himself and that is by burger and luckman in the social construction of reality the first and second circuits are evolutionary stable strategies they've worked in more or less the same form not just for primates but for other animals and many other species over vast eons of time the third semantic circuit is an evolutionary unstable strategy it could very accurately be called revolutionary rather than evolutionary the first two circuits are based on negative feedback in the biological sense they maintain homeostasis that is they return over and over to the same ecological ethological balances they function on negative feedback sorry the function of negative feedback is to return to such a steady state the time-binding semantic circuit is not based on such steady-state positive feedback it is a mechanism of what cyberneticists and biologists called positive feedback it does not return to a steady state but constantly seeks a new equilibrium at a higher energy level negative feedback returns to a fixed point like a thermostat positive feedback seeks a moving goal like a guided missile the first two circuits maintain that which is more or less constant in human affairs they are totally cyclical and relate directly to the cycles found in history by vico hegel and similar philosophers assert the third circuit has always been hemmed in and heavily sanctioned with rules laws prohibitions taboos etc because it breaks up such cycles it leads if unleashed to an upward hurling spiral in societies where the third semantic circuit has been partially unleashed it has never been totally freed in any society the upward spiral immediately appears this used to be known as progress before that word became unfashionable the upward spiral whether we call it progress or not is characteristic of what karl popper calls open societies these are secular humanistic societies cultures relatively free of taboo and dogmatism such freedom up to and including the present is only relative because many taboos are unconscious and pass themselves off as common sense or common decency whoever challenges them is by definition a heretic by definition a traitor or by definition an irresponsible nut rationalists who dominate in relatively open societies also have their own taboos as we shall see it was historian henry adams who first conceived the idea that there might be a mathematical expression describing the rate of change of human societies under the influence of newton's physics adam suggested and he was very tentative about this a fact to be remembered by those who ridicule his naivete that the utilization of energy might move forward as the inverse square of time just as newton's gravity functions as the inverse square of distance accepting the anthropology of his day adams assumed that humanity in its present form was about 90 000 plus years old he then reckoned that it took most of that time to arrive at galileo the scientific method beginnings of the industrial revolution and the great pleat and the great leap forward in energy utilization characteristic of the modern age or the open society since 300 is the inverse square of 90 000 adams assumed that the next great leap was inhab was happening while he was writing around 1900 300 years after galileo looking about him he decided this next jump to a higher energy was occurring in the researches of the curies who had just discovered radioactivity as many commentators have noted it is impossible to read atoms on the subject without feeling that he is very accurately forecasting the atomic age adams went further with the exhilaration of a great idea since 17 plus is the inverse square of 300 he predicted that the next great evolutionary stage would begin in 1917 plus and since the inverse square of 17 is 4 plus he predicted that the next step in around 19 uh that the next step would be around 1922 by then he said we should have infinite energy at our disposal it didn't quite work out that way nevertheless henry adams was on the right track his math was just oversimplified also on the right track was henry's brother brooks who is also looking for laws in history brooks observed a pattern which may or may not be entirely true but is as approximately true as the similar generalizations of vico hegel marx and twinbe every civilization brooks adams proposed goes through four stages one the monopolization of knowledge by priests eg the egyptian priests kept written language a secret among themselves as did the mayan priests two the monopolization of military power by conquerors who made themselves states or governments e.g a friend a french bastard tom payne's description of william the conqueror lands on the store a french bastard lands on the shore of england with the superior technology warriors on horse versus native warriors on foot and he becomes king his relatives and sycophants become lords of the land three the monopolization of the land by those landlords the extraction of tributes rent from those who live on the land four the monopolization of the issue of currency by national banks the extraction of tribute interest for each piece of currency put into circulation most civilizations seem to have gone through at least three of these stages not always consecutively some have passed through all four brooks adams also noted that centralized capital the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few interrelated families seems to have been moving steadily west throughout recorded history the first major accumulations are to be found in sumer the center of money power then shifted to egypt to greece to the italian peninsula to various parts of germany and then to london at the time brooks was writing around 1900 he saw the balance teetering between london and new york and he predicted the decline of the english empire would shift the balance to new york within the first half of the 20th century he seems to have been right brooks adams had no theory as to why this westward movement of wealth had been going on for 6 000 years he merely observed the pattern the shift is still continuing in the opinion of many for instance carl oglesby in the cowboy vs yankee war sees american politics since 1950 dominated by a struggle between old yankee wealth the new york boston axis which replaced london after 1900 and new cowboy wealth texas california oil and aerospace billionaires as of 1997 it looks like the cowboys are winning which is what you would expect if there were a real law between behind adam's east-west migration of capital one night in 1919 counts alfred korzynski awoke from a vivid dream tears of joy streaming down his face with a vivid sense that the passing of signals from generation to generation the third circuit time-binding function was what distinguished us from the other primates korzynski originally suggested that the time binding could be defined mathematically he dropped this idea later his math was as inadequate as henry adams but it is worth looking at for a moment to retrace the steps by which the actual law of acceleration was discovered what korzynski assumed at first was that if all the inventions discoveries etc of some hypothetical first generation of humans could be represented by p and the rates by which the second generation could surpass this r and mathematically the sum of total inventions discoveries etc at the end of the second generation would be p r p times r quite true algebraically then after third generation the stockpile would be p times r times r and after four generations p r r r generalized this becomes p times r to the power of t where c is the number of generations from whatever generation you have picked as your baseline uh there's a little blank in the copy of the pdf i have but it says the curve of if you put it on graph paper ascends more rapidly with each generation korzynski was looking straight at what alvin toffler later called future shock and was trying to write a mathematical formula for it many variables in economic t\"", "length": 3141}
{"prompt": "Here's some context that one of our new clients Amanda Scarborough submitted in the Market Research Questionnaire.... Provide a summary below.\n\nThe form \"Market Research Questionnaire For New Clients\" has been submitted with the following information:\n\nYour Company Name: Amanda Scarborough - Pitching Angel\n\nTo date, what has been the primary offer you've made to your audience?: Geared toward pitcher's themselves: Foundation Maximizer Program\\* Accuracy Maximizer Program Velocity Maximizer Program = Pitcher's Trifecta Bundle \\* can be purchased by itself, 5% of purchasers during March 2023 enrollment got Foundation ONLY, 95% of sales were some Trifecta >> https://www.pitching-angel.com/foundation Coach Maximizer Series - pitching training for coaches. pitcher's parents are encouraged to buy as well >>> https://www.pitching-angel.com/coach These are the primary offers. There are other add-ons/upsells I have: a. Intro to Movement - mini course on movement pitches (for pitchers AND parents) b. Inner Circle- additional drills and workouts, only available for people who purchase trifecta (for pitchers) c. Coaching Up Confident Pitchers - for coaches and parents of pitchers about communicating with their pitcher The Pitching Angel Experience - 3 day, in person pitching event. the first one was Dec 2022\n\nDoes this offer have buyers yet?: 3200+ for Foundation....850 for Coach Maximizer Series.....1250 for Intro to Movement\n\nWho are the main buyers?: Trifecta: Parents of pitchers buying for their daughters. Biggest % of pitchers fall between ages 9-12. There are older pitchers 13+ included in there, as well as some college aged and beyond who work through the course. USUALLY this pitcher is more in her beginner to intermediate stages. Coach Course: Pitching coaches who coach pitchers in high school or travel ball or college, pitching coaches who give private lessons, an old baseball player who now is having to learn softball pitching, parents of pitchers who don't have my trifecta, parents of pitchers who DO have my trifecta, parents who are supportive and instrumental and involved in their pitcher's pitching journey. Recently made a post on my Facebook page asking people this same question, \"who are you\"? https://www.facebook.com/amanda9scarborough/posts/pfbid022Nd1zGgrfz6GjfNzxacoSm5m3VqtP859KQEWf1G56GVJeEKx7K8kPtRPddj8X3aXl?\\_\\_cft\\_\\_[0]=AZXO4iXV8DRIK0Eiv\\_ujYxaYJkp0mlCl0X7MqFIm\\_oV8D9JV4BJHiZlf3f7xB7Up9BwuqJSWXcgV\\_NHNS53FoOnDPLre0CfSj0IDiuzl9vdjivUZdQ-HNyHQ2qsXaElXal4&\\_\\_tn\\_\\_=%2CO%2CP-R\n\nWhat do they want/desire more than anything else?: Trifecta: CONFIDENCE & self-belief for their child. Parents want their pitcher to reignite their love/passion for pitching. They want their pitcher to have fun and put in the work. They want to know she is learning the right things mechanically when it comes to pitching. They want her to stay healthy mentally and physically while playing/learning a position she's interested in. They want \"her light to shine\". Ultimately, they want their daughter to have more pitching time, but it's based on everything listed before this. As a side note: an indirect benefit that I did not expect, but one that so many all say, is how through the course they create a \"common language\" with their pitcher and they're able to communicate and work with their pitcher in a way that makes everything seem easier and get on the same page together. Coach: If it's a parent buying, they want a way to learn how to help their pitcher when she's practicing at home outside of lessons. The parent wants to make sure he/she is not \"messing her up\" and telling her the wrong thing. If it's a team coach buying, they want a way to communicate with pitchers who all work with different private coaches. If it's a coach who gives lessons buying, they want new drills, new communication and to get insight as to how/what I teach to be able to bring it to their lessons. The REAL desire of a coach for this coach course could definitely use some more insight and understanding. It has always come second fiddle to my training for pitchers, but has just as much potential as the pitching training itself.\n\nWhat's the main reason they buy?: Trifecta: They don't have a pitching coach near them. OR They have a pitching coach, but they want focused work to put in in between lessons. OR The pitcher has plateau'd in speed and results. OR They simply want new drills & workouts. OR They want to make sure they're learning the \"right\" thing. Coach: As a parent buying, they want information to better support their pitcher. As a coach buying, they want a fresh approach, new drills and workouts to implement with their pitcher.\n\nWhat is the biggest problem or challenge they are facing right now?: Trifecta: Lack of confidence, lack of work ethic, lack of pitching speed, a mechanical habit they cannot fix, a plateau in speed, inconsistency from the pitcher they see at practice to the pitcher they see during a game, inconsistency with accuracy, getting \"stuck\". Coach: same as above. Overwhelmed with the amount of information that's out there on pitching.\n\nWhat frustrates them?: Trifecta: How hard pitching is. The unknown about pitching. Not knowing if what they're learning is the right thing. Having to google a ton of drills and find them on their own somewhere on the internet. A pitching coach who is teaching them the wrong thing. No direction in terms of what should be learned first and any type of progression. Also....wasting time either learning the wrong things or wasting time pitching, only to see their daughter quit pitching. Coach: Really, the same answer as above.\n\nWhat causes them pain?: Trifecta: seeing their daughter struggle. seeing their daughter not pitch to her potential. Coach: as a parent who buys, seeing their daughter struggle and want to quit. as a coach who buys, losing games, their pitcher not being able to get out of an inning, not being able to communicate with a pitcher\n\nWhat are their insecurities?: Trifecta: that their pitcher will never figure it out, money & time being wasted, that their pitcher isn't \"tall enough\" or \"good enough\" to do it, that their pitcher isn't pitching a certain speed by a certain age, that their pitcher isn't up to the level as other pitchers on her team. Coach: For parents: that they they're going to \"mess their daughter up\" and tell her the wrong things. For coaches: that the pitcher isn't listening to what they're telling her because the pitcher doesn't believe in WHAT he/she is telling her.\n\nWhat are they angry about?: Trifecta: This is a good question, not sure if I have the answer to this one right now! Maybe they're pitcher making the same mechanical mistake over and over again and not being able to adjust? A pitcher having untapped potential and not putting in the work to see what she's capable of. Coach: That they've been taught outdated mechanics and have to learn something new/change their old way of thinking. For both pitching courses and coach course, definitely need to explore more about what they're \"angry\" about.\n\nWho are they angry at and who do they blame for their problems?: The parent blames themselves or their coach. Rarely are they angry at their child. :)\n\nWhat is the age, gender, education level, and/or location of your ideal buyer?: For pitching courses: Pitcher age: 9-12 Pitcher's parent age: 35-45 Location: Texas, California, Florida, Ohio, Illinois. Honestly they're all over the country and world. It would be great to see exact %s. Education level: Not sure\n\nWho do they follow online?: Toni Paisley Fastpitch Power Foster Fastpitch DR3 Fastpitch Rugged Softball Paulygirl Fastpitch - Rick Pauly Most of their pages are tagged in the comments on this post: https://www.facebook.com/amanda9scarborough/posts/pfbid02XeWcT9Yz31kaaBYdsekKkCdqvNiu4cWz4rFg76eG1PGMHrEnVgT7dh1LvfATp5CQl?\\_\\_cft\\_\\_[0]=AZWQiizvTul046pDBhKEYpja-PZpbXGZAaP7BH\\_fWC1icufDdjSkaaUI2NYHo4NsC9b\\_sG1VRbLSlZ6EmJO6JHN-srOCQkCNSx8ktDLj9jWDtUbUZe\\_OG5PwfNj5rTsF0I5UTtYDY6Aauvd-S87UaewI&\\_\\_tn\\_\\_=%2CO%2CP-R\n\nDo they hang out in any specific groups or forums?: The Fastpitch Zone - FB group Fastpitch Talk - FB group Softball Pitching Advice & Analysis - FB group discussfastpitch.com heybucket.com thesoftballzone.com .....and I bet so many places I don't know about!...yet\n\nCompetition:\n\nCompetition\n\nTake a look at the market for your product/service and evaluate which other companies are selling a product that would compete with yours...\n\nInformation on Your Primary Customers:\n\nInformation on Your Primary Customers\nThis will help us get to know more about your ideal avatar and ensure we are speaking directly to them...\n\nWhat other products/services like this one are your customers buying, if any?: Paisley's Pitching - https://www.paisleyspitching.com Coachataclick - https://www.coachataclick.com/?r\\_done=1 Paulgirl Fastpitch - https://www.paulygirlfastpitch.com Fastpitch Online Academy - https://www.fastpitchonlineacademy.com I believe they all have online presence. Some offer online lessons, which I do not. And/or video breakdown, which usually I do not.\n\nWhat separates your products/services from the competition?: Keeping it simple and teaching in a way that's clear and concise. Ability to have lifetime access and go at your own speed through the information. Easy to follow progressions. Will answer emails/messages from people inside as they come in if they need help. Breaking down pitching in a way that seems doable and easy for pitchers, no matter where they live. The trust they have in me from my credibility in what I achieved as a player, to how long I've had an online presence for 15 years now, to being on ESPN calling the WCWS. Being relatable...the fact I was a shorter pitcher who could throw hard AND the fact that I wasn't always the best when I was growing up. Ability to break down the mental game, talk about it, write about it, coach about it and get people to relate to it. - honestly this is probably one of the biggest things.\n\nCreator:\n\nCreator\nLet's get to know more about you and the desired outcome of your offers...\n\nWhat is important to know about you?: May of 2020 was the first time I came out with anything online with training like this. I think there's so much potential to reach TONS of people who have no idea who I am. My Amanda-scarborough.com website gets traffic from the content on it but has not been redone or integrated with anything pitching angel related and I feel like it could connect and multiple everything that's already been done. I'm ready to not only reach more people but speak to them more directly so they realize the impact my courses can have on their pitching families journey to help keep their pitcher happy, confident and pitching for a longer period of time.\n\nWhy did you create this particular offer (course/program/product/service)?: It started first and foremost with my Foundation Maximizer. Everything revolves around teaching pitchers & their parents the keys to a solid pitching foundation, because if you don't have a solid foundation, more frustration will come along the way because results won't come as easily in the longterm. And seeing results is what keeps a pitcher confidence. A foundation is the key to confidence and I want pitchers to feel like they can not only learn about what a solid foundation. is, but execute it. And if they execute it, then they'll pitch longer because the chances of them being more confidence is higher. And then on top of that, if they pitch for a longer period of time, I know they'll become even stronger, successful WOMEN once they've stopped pitching. I truly believe pitching can change a girl's life like it did mine. Then as a side note to that: I wanted to create a framework, structure and progression for people to follow instead of just piecemealing YouTube videos of mine or someone else's together. Pitching families and pitchers have so much confusion about what's the \"right\" way to learn pitching mechanics and make sure their daughters are being taught the right thing.\n\nProof:\n\nProof\nPerhaps the strongest mental trigger of them all is showcasing the success your customers are already having... but don't worry if you're just getting started, we will help you build your library of proof (testimonials, endorsements, case studies, etc) along the way.\n\nPlease list any elements that showcase credibility in your field... (i.e. education, certifications, accomplishments, awards, customer testimonials, etc...): See links to sales pages above, there are lots on there and I have Google Drive folders of them. I want us to find a way to get even MORE of these along the way!", "length": 3438}

{"prompt": "Today we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the INR 17.8 trillion (U.S. $218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.\nGautam Adani, Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group\u2019s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.\nOur research involved speaking with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group, reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.\nEven if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.\nKey listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported \u2018current ratios\u2019 below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.\nThe group\u2019s very top ranks and 8 of 22 key leaders are Adani family members, a dynamic that places control of the group\u2019s financials and key decisions in the hands of a few. A former executive described the Adani Group as \u201ca family business.\u201d\nThe Adani Group has previously been the focus of 4 major government fraud investigations which have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds and corruption, totaling an estimated U.S. $17 billion. Adani family members allegedly cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the UAE, and Caribbean Islands, generating forged import/export documentation in an apparent effort to generate fake or illegitimate turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies.\nGautam Adani\u2019s younger brother, Rajesh Adani, was accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) of playing a central role in a diamond trading import/export scheme around 2004-2005. The alleged scheme involved the use of offshore shell entities to generate artificial turnover. Rajesh was arrested at least twice over separate allegations of forgery and tax fraud. He was subsequently promoted to serve as Managing Director of Adani Group.\nGautam Adani\u2019s brother-in-law, Samir Vora, was accused by the DRI of being a ringleader of the same diamond trading scam and of repeatedly making false statements to regulators. He was subsequently promoted to Executive Director of the critical Adani Australia division.\nGautam Adani\u2019s elder brother, Vinod Adani, has been described by media as \u201can elusive figure\u201d. He has regularly been found at the center of the government\u2019s investigations into Adani for his alleged role in managing a network of offshore entities used to facilitate fraud.\nOur research, which included downloading and cataloguing the entire Mauritius corporate registry, has uncovered that Vinod Adani, through several close associates, manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities.\nWe have identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani or close associates. We have identified entities that are also surreptitiously controlled by Vinod Adani in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands.\nMany of the Vinod Adani-associated entities have no obvious signs of operations, including no reported employees, no independent addresses or phone numbers and no meaningful online presence. Despite this, they have collectively moved billions of dollars into Indian Adani publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals.\nWe have also uncovered rudimentary efforts seemingly designed to mask the nature of some of the shell entities. For example, 13 websites were created for Vinod Adani-associated entities; many were suspiciously formed on the same days, featuring only stock photos, naming no actual employees and listing the same set of nonsensical services, such as \u201cconsumption abroad\u201d and \u201ccommercial presence\u201d.\nThe Vinod-Adani shells seem to serve several functions, including (1) stock parking / stock manipulation (2) and laundering money through Adani\u2019s private companies onto the listed companies\u2019 balance sheets in order to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency.\nPublicly listed companies in India are subject to rules that require all promoter holdings (known as insider holdings in the U.S.) to be disclosed. Rules also require that listed companies have at least 25% of the float held by non-promoters in order to mitigate manipulation and insider trading. 4 of Adani\u2019s listed companies are on the brink of the delisting threshold due to high promoter ownership.\nOur research indicates that offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest \u201cpublic\u201d (i.e., non-promoter) holders of Adani stock, an issue that would subject the Adani companies to delisting, were Indian securities regulator SEBI\u2019s rules enforced.\nMany of the supposed \u201cpublic\u201d funds exhibit flagrant irregularities such as being (1) Mauritius or offshore-based entities, often shells (2) with beneficial ownership concealed via nominee directors (3) and with little to no diversification, holding portfolios almost exclusively consisting of shares in Adani listed companies.\nRight to Information (RTI) requests we filed with SEBI confirm that the offshore funds are the subjects of an ongoing investigation, more than a year-and-a-half after concerns were initially raised by media and members of parliament.\nA former trader for Elara, an offshore fund with almost $3 billion in concentrated holdings of Adani shares, including a fund that is ~99% concentrated in shares of Adani, told us that it is obvious that Adani controls the shares. He explained that the funds are intentionally structured to conceal their ultimate beneficial ownership.\nLeaked emails show that the CEO of Elara worked on deals with Dharmesh Doshi, a fugitive accountant who worked closely on stock manipulation deals with Ketan Parekh, an infamous Indian market manipulator. The emails indicate that the CEO of Elara worked with Doshi on stock deals after he evaded arrest and was widely known as a fugitive.\nAnother firm called Monterosa Investment Holdings controls 5 supposedly independent funds that collectively hold over INR 360 billion (U.S. $4.5 billion) in shares of listed Adani companies, according to Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data and Indian exchange data.\nMonterosa\u2019s Chairman and CEO served as director in 3 companies alongside a fugitive diamond merchant who allegedly stole U.S. $1 billion before fleeing India. Vinod Adani\u2019s daughter married the fugitive diamond merchant\u2019s son.\nA once-related party entity of Adani invested heavily in one of the Monterosa funds that allocated to Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, according to corporate records, drawing a clear line between the Adani Group and the suspect offshore funds.\nAnother Cyprus-based entity called New Leaina Investments until June-September 2021 owned over U.S. $420 million in Adani Green Energy shares, comprising ~95% of its portfolio. Parliamentary records show it was (and may still be) a shareholder of other Adani listed entities.\nNew Leaina is operated by incorporation services firm Amicorp, which has worked extensively to aid Adani in developing its offshore entity network. Amicorp formed at least 7 Adani promoter entities, at least 17 offshore shells and entities associated with Vinod Adani, and at least 3 Mauritius-based offshore shareholders of Adani stock.\nAmicorp played a key role in the 1MDB international fraud scandal that resulted in U.S. $4.5 billion being siphoned from Malaysian taxpayers. Amicorp established \u2018investment funds\u2019 for the key perpetrators that were \u201csimply a way to wash a client\u2019s money through what looked like a mutual fund\u201d, according to the book Billion Dollar Whale, which reported on the scandal.\n\u2018Delivery volume\u2019 is a unique daily data point that reports institutional investment flows. Our analysis found that offshore suspected stock parking entities accounted for up to 30%-47% of yearly \u2018delivery volume\u2019 in several Adani listed companies, a flagrant irregularity indicating that Adani stocks have likely been subject to \u2018wash trading\u2019 or other forms of manipulative trading via the suspect offshore entities.\nEvidence of stock manipulation in Adani listed companies shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. SEBI has investigated and prosecuted more than 70 entities and individuals over the years, including Adani promoters, for pumping Adani Enterprises\u2019 stock.\nA 2007 SEBI ruling stated that \u201cthe charges leveled against promoters of Adani that they aided and abetted Ketan Parekh entities in manipulating the scrip of Adani stand proved\u201d. Ketan Parekh is perhaps India\u2019s most notorious stock market manipulator. Adani Group entities originally received bans for their roles, but those were later reduced to fines, a show of government leniency toward the Group that has become a decades-long pattern.\nPer the 2007 investigation, 14 Adani private entities transferred shares to entities controlled by Parekh, who then engaged in blatant market manipulation. Adani Group responded to SEBI by arguing that it had dealt with Ketan Parekh to finance the start of its operations at Mundra port, seemingly suggesting that share sales via stock manipulation somehow constitutes a legitimate form of financing.\nAs part of our investigation, we interviewed an individual who was banned from trading on Indian markets for stock manipulation via Mauritius-based funds. He told us that he knew Ketan Parekh personally, and that little has changed, explaining \u201call the previous clients are still loyal to Ketan and are still working with Ketan\u201d.\nIn addition to using offshore capital to park stock, we found numerous examples of offshore shells sending money through onshore private Adani companies onto listed public Adani companies.\nThe funds then seem to be used to engineer Adani\u2019s accounting (whether by bolstering its reported profit or cash flows), cushioning its capital balances in order to make listed entities appear more creditworthy, or simply moved back out to other parts of the Adani empire where capital is needed.\nWe also identified numerous undisclosed related party transactions by both listed and private companies, seemingly an open and repeated violation of Indian disclosure laws.\nIn one instance, a Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity with no signs of substantive operations lent INR 11.71 billion (U.S. ~$253 million at that time) to a private Adani entity which did not disclose it as being a related party loan. The private entity subsequently lent funds to listed entities, including INR 9.84 billion (U.S. $138 million at more recent substantially lower exchange rates) to Adani Enterprises.\nAnother Vinod Adani-controlled UAE entity called Emerging Market Investment DMCC lists no employees on LinkedIn, has no substantive online presence, has announced no clients or deals, and is based out of an apartment in the UAE. It lent U.S. $1 billion to an Adani Power subsidiary.\nThis offshore shell network also seems to be used for earnings manipulation. For example, we detail a series of transactions where assets were transferred from a subsidiary of listed Adani Enterprises to a private Singaporean entity controlled by Vinod Adani, without disclosure of the related party nature of these deals. Once on the books of the private entity, the assets were almost immediately impaired, likely helping the public entity avoid a material write-down and negative impact to net income.\nAdani Group\u2019s obvious accounting irregularities and sketchy dealings seem to be enabled by virtually non-existent financial controls. Listed Adani companies have seen sustained turnover in the Chief Financial Officer role. For example, Adani Enterprises has had 5 chief financial officers over the course of 8 years, a key red flag indicating potential accounting issues.\nThe independent auditor for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas is a tiny firm called Shah Dhandharia. Shah Dhandharia seems to have no current website. Historical archives of its website show that it had only 4 partners and 11 employees. Records show it pays INR 32,000 (U.S. $435 in 2021) in monthly office rent. The only other listed entity we found that it audits has a market capitalization of about INR 640 million (U.S. $7.8 million).\nShah Dhandharia hardly seems capable of complex audit work. Adani Enterprises alone has 156 subsidiaries and many more joint ventures and affiliates, for example. Further, Adani\u2019s 7 key listed entities collectively have 578 subsidiaries and have engaged in a total of 6,025 separate related-party transactions in fiscal year 2022 alone, per BSE disclosures.\nThe audit partners at Shah Dhandharia who respectively signed off on Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas\u2019 annual audits were as young as 24 and 23 years old when they began approving the audits. They were essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country, run by one of its most powerful individuals.\nGautam Adani has claimed in an interview to \u201chave a very open mind towards criticism\u2026Every criticism gives me an opportunity to improve myself.\u201d Despite these claims, Adani has repeatedly sought to have critical journalists or commentators jailed or silenced through litigation, using his immense power to pressure the government and regulators to pursue those who question him.\nWe believe the Adani Group has been able to operate a large, flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors, journalists, citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.\nWe have included 88 questions in the conclusion of our report.

{"prompt": "Today we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the INR 17.8 trillion (U.S. $218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.\nGautam Adani, Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group\u2019s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.\nOur research involved speaking with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group, reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.\nEven if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.\nKey listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported \u2018current ratios\u2019 below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.\nThe group\u2019s very top ranks and 8 of 22 key leaders are Adani family members, a dynamic that places control of the group\u2019s financials and key decisions in the hands of a few. A former executive described the Adani Group as \u201ca family business.\u201d\nThe Adani Group has previously been the focus of 4 major government fraud investigations which have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds and corruption, totaling an estimated U.S. $17 billion. Adani family members allegedly cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the UAE, and Caribbean Islands, generating forged import/export documentation in an apparent effort to generate fake or illegitimate turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies.\nGautam Adani\u2019s younger brother, Rajesh Adani, was accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) of playing a central role in a diamond trading import/export scheme around 2004-2005. The alleged scheme involved the use of offshore shell entities to generate artificial turnover. Rajesh was arrested at least twice over separate allegations of forgery and tax fraud. He was subsequently promoted to serve as Managing Director of Adani Group.\nGautam Adani\u2019s brother-in-law, Samir Vora, was accused by the DRI of being a ringleader of the same diamond trading scam and of repeatedly making false statements to regulators. He was subsequently promoted to Executive Director of the critical Adani Australia division.\nGautam Adani\u2019s elder brother, Vinod Adani, has been described by media as \u201can elusive figure\u201d. He has regularly been found at the center of the government\u2019s investigations into Adani for his alleged role in managing a network of offshore entities used to facilitate fraud.\nOur research, which included downloading and cataloguing the entire Mauritius corporate registry, has uncovered that Vinod Adani, through several close associates, manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities.\nWe have identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani or close associates. We have identified entities that are also surreptitiously controlled by Vinod Adani in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands.\nMany of the Vinod Adani-associated entities have no obvious signs of operations, including no reported employees, no independent addresses or phone numbers and no meaningful online presence. Despite this, they have collectively moved billions of dollars into Indian Adani publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals.\nWe have also uncovered rudimentary efforts seemingly designed to mask the nature of some of the shell entities. For example, 13 websites were created for Vinod Adani-associated entities; many were suspiciously formed on the same days, featuring only stock photos, naming no actual employees and listing the same set of nonsensical services, such as \u201cconsumption abroad\u201d and \u201ccommercial presence\u201d.\nThe Vinod-Adani shells seem to serve several functions, including (1) stock parking / stock manipulation (2) and laundering money through Adani\u2019s private companies onto the listed companies\u2019 balance sheets in order to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency.\nPublicly listed companies in India are subject to rules that require all promoter holdings (known as insider holdings in the U.S.) to be disclosed. Rules also require that listed companies have at least 25% of the float held by non-promoters in order to mitigate manipulation and insider trading. 4 of Adani\u2019s listed companies are on the brink of the delisting threshold due to high promoter ownership.\nOur research indicates that offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest \u201cpublic\u201d (i.e., non-promoter) holders of Adani stock, an issue that would subject the Adani companies to delisting, were Indian securities regulator SEBI\u2019s rules enforced.\nMany of the supposed \u201cpublic\u201d funds exhibit flagrant irregularities such as being (1) Mauritius or offshore-based entities, often shells (2) with beneficial ownership concealed via nominee directors (3) and with little to no diversification, holding portfolios almost exclusively consisting of shares in Adani listed companies.\nRight to Information (RTI) requests we filed with SEBI confirm that the offshore funds are the subjects of an ongoing investigation, more than a year-and-a-half after concerns were initially raised by media and members of parliament.\nA former trader for Elara, an offshore fund with almost $3 billion in concentrated holdings of Adani shares, including a fund that is ~99% concentrated in shares of Adani, told us that it is obvious that Adani controls the shares. He explained that the funds are intentionally structured to conceal their ultimate beneficial ownership.\nLeaked emails show that the CEO of Elara worked on deals with Dharmesh Doshi, a fugitive accountant who worked closely on stock manipulation deals with Ketan Parekh, an infamous Indian market manipulator. The emails indicate that the CEO of Elara worked with Doshi on stock deals after he evaded arrest and was widely known as a fugitive.\nAnother firm called Monterosa Investment Holdings controls 5 supposedly independent funds that collectively hold over INR 360 billion (U.S. $4.5 billion) in shares of listed Adani companies, according to Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data and Indian exchange data.\nMonterosa\u2019s Chairman and CEO served as director in 3 companies alongside a fugitive diamond merchant who allegedly stole U.S. $1 billion before fleeing India. Vinod Adani\u2019s daughter married the fugitive diamond merchant\u2019s son.\nA once-related party entity of Adani invested heavily in one of the Monterosa funds that allocated to Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, according to corporate records, drawing a clear line between the Adani Group and the suspect offshore funds.\nAnother Cyprus-based entity called New Leaina Investments until June-September 2021 owned over U.S. $420 million in Adani Green Energy shares, comprising ~95% of its portfolio. Parliamentary records show it was (and may still be) a shareholder of other Adani listed entities.\nNew Leaina is operated by incorporation services firm Amicorp, which has worked extensively to aid Adani in developing its offshore entity network. Amicorp formed at least 7 Adani promoter entities, at least 17 offshore shells and entities associated with Vinod Adani, and at least 3 Mauritius-based offshore shareholders of Adani stock.\nAmicorp played a key role in the 1MDB international fraud scandal that resulted in U.S. $4.5 billion being siphoned from Malaysian taxpayers. Amicorp established \u2018investment funds\u2019 for the key perpetrators that were \u201csimply a way to wash a client\u2019s money through what looked like a mutual fund\u201d, according to the book Billion Dollar Whale, which reported on the scandal.\n\u2018Delivery volume\u2019 is a unique daily data point that reports institutional investment flows. Our analysis found that offshore suspected stock parking entities accounted for up to 30%-47% of yearly \u2018delivery volume\u2019 in several Adani listed companies, a flagrant irregularity indicating that Adani stocks have likely been subject to \u2018wash trading\u2019 or other forms of manipulative trading via the suspect offshore entities.\nEvidence of stock manipulation in Adani listed companies shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. SEBI has investigated and prosecuted more than 70 entities and individuals over the years, including Adani promoters, for pumping Adani Enterprises\u2019 stock.\nA 2007 SEBI ruling stated that \u201cthe charges leveled against promoters of Adani that they aided and abetted Ketan Parekh entities in manipulating the scrip of Adani stand proved\u201d. Ketan Parekh is perhaps India\u2019s most notorious stock market manipulator. Adani Group entities originally received bans for their roles, but those were later reduced to fines, a show of government leniency toward the Group that has become a decades-long pattern.\nPer the 2007 investigation, 14 Adani private entities transferred shares to entities controlled by Parekh, who then engaged in blatant market manipulation. Adani Group responded to SEBI by arguing that it had dealt with Ketan Parekh to finance the start of its operations at Mundra port, seemingly suggesting that share sales via stock manipulation somehow constitutes a legitimate form of financing.\nAs part of our investigation, we interviewed an individual who was banned from trading on Indian markets for stock manipulation via Mauritius-based funds. He told us that he knew Ketan Parekh personally, and that little has changed, explaining \u201call the previous clients are still loyal to Ketan and are still working with Ketan\u201d.\nIn addition to using offshore capital to park stock, we found numerous examples of offshore shells sending money through onshore private Adani companies onto listed public Adani companies.\nThe funds then seem to be used to engineer Adani\u2019s accounting (whether by bolstering its reported profit or cash flows), cushioning its capital balances in order to make listed entities appear more creditworthy, or simply moved back out to other parts of the Adani empire where capital is needed.\nWe also identified numerous undisclosed related party transactions by both listed and private companies, seemingly an open and repeated violation of Indian disclosure laws.\nIn one instance, a Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity with no signs of substantive operations lent INR 11.71 billion (U.S. ~$253 million at that time) to a private Adani entity which did not disclose it as being a related party loan. The private entity subsequently lent funds to listed entities, including INR 9.84 billion (U.S. $138 million at more recent substantially lower exchange rates) to Adani Enterprises.\nAnother Vinod Adani-controlled UAE entity called Emerging Market Investment DMCC lists no employees on LinkedIn, has no substantive online presence, has announced no clients or deals, and is based out of an apartment in the UAE. It lent U.S. $1 billion to an Adani Power subsidiary.\nThis offshore shell network also seems to be used for earnings manipulation. For example, we detail a series of transactions where assets were transferred from a subsidiary of listed Adani Enterprises to a private Singaporean entity controlled by Vinod Adani, without disclosure of the related party nature of these deals. Once on the books of the private entity, the assets were almost immediately impaired, likely helping the public entity avoid a material write-down and negative impact to net income.\nAdani Group\u2019s obvious accounting irregularities and sketchy dealings seem to be enabled by virtually non-existent financial controls. Listed Adani companies have seen sustained turnover in the Chief Financial Officer role. For example, Adani Enterprises has had 5 chief financial officers over the course of 8 years, a key red flag indicating potential accounting issues.\nThe independent auditor for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas is a tiny firm called Shah Dhandharia. Shah Dhandharia seems to have no current website. Historical archives of its website show that it had only 4 partners and 11 employees. Records show it pays INR 32,000 (U.S. $435 in 2021) in monthly office rent. The only other listed entity we found that it audits has a market capitalization of about INR 640 million (U.S. $7.8 million).\nShah Dhandharia hardly seems capable of complex audit work. Adani Enterprises alone has 156 subsidiaries and many more joint ventures and affiliates, for example. Further, Adani\u2019s 7 key listed entities collectively have 578 subsidiaries and have engaged in a total of 6,025 separate related-party transactions in fiscal year 2022 alone, per BSE disclosures.\nThe audit partners at Shah Dhandharia who respectively signed off on Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas\u2019 annual audits were as young as 24 and 23 years old when they began approving the audits. They were essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country, run by one of its most powerful individuals.\nGautam Adani has claimed in an interview to \u201chave a very open mind towards criticism\u2026Every criticism gives me an opportunity to improve myself.\u201d Despite these claims, Adani has repeatedly sought to have critical journalists or commentators jailed or silenced through litigation, using his immense power to pressure the government and regulators to pursue those who question him.\nWe believe the Adani Group has been able to operate a large, flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors, journalists, citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.\nWe have included 88 questions in the conclusion of our report. If Gautam Adani truly embraces transparency, as he claims, they should be easy questions to answer. We look forward to Adani\u2019s response.\n\nsummarise this in the best way possible,", "length": 3481}

{"prompt": "explain in detail the summary of this paper in no less than 1000 words? ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) imposes a major burden on global public health which is exacerbated by the escalating number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. There is consequently an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. We have investigated the natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) for repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Here, we report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. Moreover, the FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCombination therapy is essential to the clinical management of tuberculosis (TB) disease (1). Until recently, strategies to identify and advance promising combinations during early-stage pre-clinical TB drug discovery were limited. However, growing recognition of the need to identify new anti-TB drugs and regimens has re-focused attention on early-stage pre-clinical identification of synergizing combination partners for potential development (2), including drugs which are not clinically effective against TB (3, 4).\n\nAs part of a drug repurposing strategy, we utilized fusidic acid (FA) as anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combination(s) that might be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy. FA, a translational inhibitor with demonstrated (albeit moderate) activity in vitro (5, 6), was selected owing to its unique mechanism of action: specifically, inhibition of mycobacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) (7). The antimicrobial-potentiating effect of FA with other antibiotics including the frontline anti-TB drug, ethambutol (EMB), as well as its lack of cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes, provided additional motivation for our choice of FA (8, 9). In this short report, we present the analysis of in vitro interactions between FA and partner compounds comprising drugs currently used in TB treatment and selected translational inhibitors, the latter selected to enable evaluation the effects of combining FA with drugs acting on the same pathway (Fig. 1), (10, 11).\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nAntibiotic targets in protein synthesis:\nSchematic representation indicating known and predicted target sites of antibiotics disrupting different stages in the (myco)bacterial translation pathway. The tRNA binding sites - amino acid (A), peptide (P), and exit (E) - on the ribosome are indicated. Adopted and modified from Wilson et al. (10).\n\nRESULTS\nCheckerboard assay identifies synergistic drug combination partners for fusidic acid\nTo identify potential partners of FA, our preliminary screens utilized Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, a fast-growing, non-pathogenic mycobacterium which has been exploited as a useful surrogate in drug efficacy studies in vitro. In standard two-drug checkerboard experiments (Table S1), SPC, ERY, CLR and TET exhibited synergy with FA, defined as FICI \u2264 0.5. These combinations displayed a 4-to 16-fold reduction in MIC90 for each of the individual drugs (Fig. S1). No antagonistic effects were observed with any of the combinations tested.\n\nThe synergies detected in M. smegmatis informed subsequent selection of combination partners for evaluation in M. tuberculosis using the checkerboard method. In addition, representative drugs consisting of clinically used anti-TB agents (first- and second-line) and selected translational inhibitors were tested in combination with FA. For these assays, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv reporter strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used, as described previously (12). Fig. S2 provides an example of an interaction study in which FA and ERY were analysed in the checkerboard assay. Results in Table 1 show similarity to those obtained for M. smegmatis, such that SPC, ERY and CLR exhibited synergy with FA against M. tuberculosis. The combination of FA and ERY returned a FICI value of 0.25, indicating a synergistic interaction (Fig. S2A). Other drugs that synergized with FA included RIF, STR, roxithromycin (ROX), and LZD. These synergistic interactions generally resulted in 4-to 8-fold reductions in the MICs of each drug within the combination. Even though the combination of FA and BDQ did not result in a FICI value of \u2264 0.5, it is important to note that the two displayed approximately a 4-fold reduction in their respective MICs, and the observed FICI (0.55) was very close to that defined as \u201csynergy\u201d. No antagonistic interaction was observed between FA and any of the compounds tested. For the combinations exhibiting synergy with FA, isobolograms were constructed by plotting the FIC curves of the FA-drug combinations (Fig. S3). Interactions between FA and ERY, SPC, and RIF were well within the synergy region (FICI < 0.5) whereas FA with STR, LZD, and ROX indicated borderline synergy (FICI = 0.5). The FA-INH interaction was included as a \u201cno interaction\u201d control.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nIn vitro synergistic interaction between FA and anti TB agents or selected translational inhibitors against M. tuberculosis::gfp\n\nTo confirm results obtained using the checkerboard assay, the strongly synergistic FA-ERY combination was evaluated in a growth inhibition assay (Fig. S4). For this purpose, FA and ERY were used at 0.3 and 27 \u00b5M, respectively, since these were the concentrations at which the lowest FICI value was obtained in the checkerboard assay (Fig. S2). RIF, at a concentration of 0.015 \u00b5M, was included as a control. In the absence of drug, the population of M. tuberculosis increased over 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the population of viable cells remained relatively constant over the same duration when the growth medium contained the FA and ERY combination. Similarly, the medium containing FA, ERY plus sub-MIC RIF did not display any increase in the number of viable bacterial population over a 14-day period. In contrast, cultures incubated in the presence of the individual antibiotics, FA or ERY, showed equivalent growth to the untreated control.\n\nAssessing synergistic and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FA synergizing drugs for optimal therapy\nAs a key consideration for the clinical potential of FA combinations, the respective concentrations at which synergy was observed were compared with the reported peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) for each drug. This is important in understanding whether the concentrations required to achieve the desired response are therapeutically feasible \u2013 and, consequently, whether the results obtained from an in vitro assay have any utility in guiding therapeutic use. Except for the FA-ERY interaction, synergies between FA and its partners were achieved at concentrations predicted to be below the maximum plasma concentrations (13, 14), suggesting that these concentrations are therapeutically achievable (Fig. S5). For example, the presence of FA decreased the MIC of SPC from 201 \u00b5M to 3.14 \u00b5M, which represents a greater than 98% reduction in the MIC (Table S2). This reduced concentration is far below the Cmax value of SPC in humans (30.8 \u00b5M), determined following a 1000 mg intramuscular dose (15).\n\nAssessing cidal versus static synergies\nTo determine whether FA interactions resulted in killing or merely inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, the method of Zhang et al. was utilized (16). INH, a bactericidal agent, was used as a reference drug, and all drugs were tested alone and in combination against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp bioreporter strain. Results for the bacteriostatic or cidal effects of the drug combinations with FA are illustrated (Figure 2). The FA-RIF combination displayed a MBC/MIC ratio of \u2264 2 on day 14 of evaluation, suggesting cidality. The other combinations tested \u2013 combining FA with SPC, ERY, CLR, ROX or LZD \u2013 all exhibited MBC/MIC ratios >2, implying static effects. The bacteriostatic/cidal action of individual drugs is shown in Fig. S6.\n\nFigure 2.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 2.\nBactericidal versus static effects of drug combinations against M. tuberculosis.\nAnalysis of FA in combination with synergizing drugs; ERY, SPC, CLR, ROX, RIF, and LZD. INH was used as reference drug. MBC/MIC ratio \u22642: cidal; MBC/MIC ratio > 2: static. \\*Sub-inhibitory concentrations of FA that exhibited the respective synergies in these checkerboard experiments are between (0.3 \u2013 1.2 \u00b5M) Data are from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations, calculated from the mean of triplicate samples.\n\nFA synergizing partners are active against the FA-resistant mutant\nA cross-resistance study was performed using a FA-resistant M. tuberculosis mutant carrying H462Y mutation in fusA1(11). The FA-resistant mutant exhibited >100-fold MIC compared to the FA-susceptible parental strain. Six synergistic FA partner drugs \u2013 RIF, SPC, CLR, ERY, STR and ROX \u2013 were evaluated using the resazurin reduction microplate assay (REMA). The results (Fig. S7) indicated that the MIC90 values of these drugs remained the same against the FA-resistant mutant relative to the wild-type strain, confirming that there was no cross-resistance to each of the tested compounds.\n\nInteraction of FA synergizing partners with selected chemically unrelated compounds\nUsing a set of six chemically and structurally diverse drug agents (Table S3), a combination assay was performed with four drugs that had displayed synergistic interaction with FA: RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC. The aim was to determine whether these compounds displayed synergy only with FA or exhibited a wider spectrum of synergistic interactions. The results of these pairwise combinations (Figure 3) revealed potentiating interactions between all FA synergizing partners (except RIF) and THS, BDQ and CPZ. CLR displayed strong synergies with BDQ and CPZ (FICI = 0.23 in both cases). The interaction between SPC and INH was also synergistic, while the remaining compounds (EMB and MOX) exhibited no interactions in combination with RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC.\n\nFigure 3.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nDrug interaction study.\nPairwise interactions between selected drugs (blue fonts) and synergizing agents (black fonts) of FA (using M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp. Red panels indicate synergistic interactions (FICI \u2264 0.5), while green panels are no interaction (0.5 < FICI \u2264 4). The bars indicate the fold-reduction in MIC required to achieve the same effect in combination versus single-drug assays. For example, in the interaction between RIF and MOX, top right-hand panel, the FIC for RIF = 0.45 (black bar) and MOX = 0.9 (blue bar). The resulting FICI for RIF-MOX = 1.35 (green bar) which indicates an additive interaction. Data are from the representative experiment performed in duplicate.", "length": 3130}

over the next 30 minutes we're going to be doing a\u00a0 detailed breakdown of everything this book has to offer\u00a0 we're going to go over flow states the top 10 brave foods to supercharge your\u00a0 brain the four modern day villains that are\u00a0 holding you back how to find your laser focus the eight intelligences\u00a0 unlocking your memory and heaps more let's jump into it\u00a0 alright so i'm super excited to be breaking down this book today\u00a0 this was by far one of my favorite books i've read this year mainly because i found this book to be super practical\u00a0 and it seemed more like a practical guide than just a heap of\u00a0 uh information about self-help\u00a0 at the end of each section there were plenty of practice exercises that you\u00a0 could implement into your life straight away\u00a0 so the book is broken down into four main parts\u00a0 freeing your mind mindset motivation and methods so what is mindset\u00a0 the deeply held beliefs attitudes and assumptions we create about who we are\u00a0 how the world works and what we are\u00a0 capable of and deserve and what is possible this anecdote comes a little bit later in the book but i found it\u00a0 a useful example so i'd like to share it here first\u00a0 he gives an example of a young elephant that is chained to a stake in the ground\u00a0 and as the elephant grows into a fully mature elephant\u00a0 its mind has placed limitations on itself\u00a0 although it could easily rip the small flimsy stake out of the ground\u00a0\u00a0 to be free\u00a0 it has developed this learned helplessness so it doesn't even try\u00a0 and the book goes into this concept of unlimiting which is the act or process of casting aside inaccurate\u00a0 and restrictive perceptions and embracing the reality that with the\u00a0 right mindset motivation and\u00a0\u00a0 methods there are no limitations\u00a0 so the book is broken down into these sections accordingly\u00a0 mindset motivation and methods and this is the core philosophy of the book\u00a0 modern day supervillains the 4ds these are the modern day villains that\u00a0 15 years ago we weren't even dealing with\u00a0 so let me introduce the four villains and then i'll give you some of the remedies that the author suggests for each one\u00a0 the first of the d's is digital deluge compared to the 15th century we now\u00a0 consume as much data in a single day as an average person from the 1400s would\u00a0 have absorbed in their entire lifetime so that is\u00a0 amazing and we are being bombarded with data\u00a0 we're always switched on we're always hooked up to the net\u00a0 humans today are consuming three times more than our parents in the 1960s\u00a0 there's just too much information too much neural activity going on and all of that extra activity can have ill effects on our brains\u00a0 it can lead to things like brain fog subpar memory and fatigue\u00a0 chances are that you guys have probably felt that body fatigue after a long\u00a0 period\u00a0 in front of a screen the second d is digital distraction so\u00a0 we live here now and because of our always-on\u00a0 ever-connected devices we're struggling to find connection when we're with\u00a0 friends and family and we're struggling to stay focused at work\u00a0 so this is where we live now we're connected to the web in every downtime moment waiting for the bus waiting in a line\u00a0 um we need to think what happens when this is our constant way of being\u00a0 when every downtime moment is filled with shining screens and all this extra\u00a0 stimulus this is leading to less social\u00a0 interaction with friends and family because our devices make us feel more\u00a0 secure but actually we're less happy next\u00a0 digital dementia neuroscientist manfred spitzer uses the term digital dementia\u00a0 to describe how overuse of digital technology\u00a0 results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities he argues that short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from\u00a0 under use if we overuse technology in the past we\u00a0 needed to remember things like people's phone\u00a0 numbers street addresses things like this\u00a0 now millennials obtain all their answers to problems at the click of a mouse\u00a0 or the swipe of a finger the reliance on technology to solve every question\u00a0 confuses people's perception of their own knowledge and intelligence\u00a0 and that reliance may well lead to overconfidence and poor decision making\u00a0 before the internet we didn't have the immediate and readily available access\u00a0 to the opinions of others we needed to reflect\u00a0 reason draw our own conclusions from our own\u00a0 insights so if technology is doing all the deductions for us they also found that the longer that person had been driving the larger the\u00a0 hippocampus was in their brain so in short the brain is malleable it's\u00a0 able to expand and change over time and it\u00a0 can change its structure to meet its cognitive load\u00a0 our second brain is the brain in our gut or the ens\u00a0 the enteric nervous system scientists don't know everything there is to know\u00a0 about the smaller brain however they are\u00a0 beginning to understand how it can affect our mood and our behavior\u00a0 without going into too much detail it is believed that the second brain in our and your physical condition of your body physiology\u00a0 so you might want to ask yourself how motivated\u00a0 and energized are you to learn what you have to learn\u00a0 what are some things you can do to change your state maybe change your\u00a0 posture\u00a0 do some stretching some breathing exercises\u00a0 you can try some of these before you sit down to study\u00a0 t is for teach if you want to cut your learning curve dramatically\u00a0 learn with the intention of teaching the information to someone else\u00a0 e is for enter what is the simplest and most powerful of someone with steel genius would be sergey brin of google\u00a0 the main concept here is that genius extends beyond academics\u00a0 so don't limit yourself by negative self-talk like\u00a0 i'm just not intelligent i always got bad grades at college so therefore i\u00a0 mustn't even be in the realm of genius\u00a0 you can be a mixture of different geniuses so have a think about what your\u00a0 genius is and let it free\u00a0 overcoming limiting beliefs before we go\u00a0 over the steps that he advises to overcome limiting beliefs like man i always screw up this sort of thing or\u00a0 i'm just not a good companion to be around try to counteract that with\u00a0 something like um just because i haven't always been good at this\u00a0 in the past doesn't mean that i can't be\u00a0 great at this now and in the future so\u00a0 that is step one make sure you get to the source of it and identify it give it\u00a0 a name step two get to the facts the steak is\u00a0 small in size i'm a strong fully grown elephant what\u00a0 is to stop me from ripping that steak right out of the ground if you believe it can grow and then you can put in the work to make it grow\u00a0 lie number two we only use ten percent of our brains\u00a0 new belief i am learning to use my whole brain\u00a0 in the best way possible line number three mistakes are failures\u00a0 the new belief you want to create is that mistakes are signs that you're\u00a0 trying something new and they are opportunities to learn life\u00a0 isn't about comparing yourself to anyone else\u00a0 it's about comparing yourself to who you were yesterday\u00a0 there's no such thing as failure only a failure to learn s3 to prevent us from getting overwhelmed and\u00a0 paralyzed let's go a little bit deeper into purpose\u00a0 as we establish earlier we don't have to enjoy something to be motivated to do it\u00a0 however you do need to have a clear purpose for\u00a0 why you were doing something you can ask yourself\u00a0 why must i study this or why must i learn this\u00a0 the book also outlines not to get confused between\u00a0 passion and purpose your purpose is what you are here on earth for\u00a0 and maybe it is to help people so the author jim's passion is learning but his values allow him to choose what things to pursue in life\u00a0 and what things to deny he doesn't mind having\u00a0 uh fomo which he he calls fomo which is the fear of missing out\u00a0 especially if that thing that he is being asked to be a part of doesn't\u00a0 in any way contribute to his values or his uh purpose in life\u00a0 and he uh he actually had a word uh which i'm currently blank on\u00a0 uh uh jomo uh jomo he said to encourage you to have\u00a0 jomo which is the joy of missing out instead of fomo the fear of missing out you know attainable chunks it become it became manageable\u00a0 flow state okay let's take a\u00a0 quote from the book i'm sure there have been times when you were\u00a0 so completely caught up in what you were doing that everything else disappeared\u00a0 and it just felt like the most natural thing you've ever done\u00a0 time probably melted away from you during those experiences\u00a0 people regularly tell me about focusing so deeply on what they are doing\u00a0 that they had no idea that afternoon had become night\u00a0 or they had missed multiple meals in the process vision is competing for your brain's finite energy\u00a0 so a messy desk with many different objects and colors\u00a0 will make your brain more fatigued than having a tidy clean desk without\u00a0 any distractions and this is essential that all\u00a0 all distractions are eliminated because it can take almost\u00a0 20 minutes to refocus and get back into the flow\u00a0 if you get kicked out of it by a distraction so\u00a0 make sure you do whatever you can to eliminate any potential distractions\u00a0 next allow enough time if you're serious about getting into a flow state at least 90 minutes for whatever i'm focusing on\u00a0 the final part of this book is part three which is methods the how\u00a0 when the billionaire investor warren buffett was asked what factor do you\u00a0 feel has been the most important in getting to where you've gotten in life\u00a0 buffered immediately replied focus and bill gates who is sitting next to him\u00a0 agreed steve jobs has also harped on the importance of focus\u00a0 for steve jobs focus was the ability to say no to almost everything\u00a0 and carefully choose what to spend his precious time on the breathing techniques also fail the only thing you can do next is to\u00a0 confront that stress uh confront that thing that is causing\u00a0 you stress and lastly schedule time in your\u00a0 calendar for whatever is distracting you or giving you distress\u00a0 okay moving on study why are most of us restrained in our\u00a0 ability ability to study most people do not know how to study of\u00a0 effectively because they were never taught\u00a0 many people naturally assume they already know how to learn\u00a0 the challenge is that most of the techniques that we use now impact on your success be aware of your posture\u00a0 if you're slumped over this can stifle your breathing\u00a0 and it will make you prematurely tired so you want to sit up straight improve\u00a0 your posture and see if you can feel or see if you\u00a0 can change that state\u00a0 the sixth habit is to listen with your whole brain\u00a0 so you want to get better at listening and actually listening\u00a0 to someone when they're speaking not just waiting to reply to the person\u00a0 so you want to hold yourself actively listen\u00a0 don't think about your to-do list or what you're going to watch on netflix if you're trying to remember someone's someone's name when you first hear it\u00a0 you want to try and link it to a visual image so\u00a0 if their last name is baker then you might want to imagine\u00a0 a baker with a big white hat next is to link words via association\u00a0 so try to link new information to old information\u00a0 if you can associate the new information with something that you're\u00a0 already familiar with it will greatly improve your memory\u00a0 so what comes to your mind when you think of a cherry perhaps red suddenly it starts raining batteries and berries\u00a0 the balloons pop and the berries splatter all over the ground\u00a0 so we could continue in that fashion but i think you get the idea\u00a0 you could break down each line of the periodic table into a short story\u00a0 or you could break down each list that you have into\u00a0 a short story and that will greatly help\u00a0 you to memorize the information\u00a0 okay so let's move down here to speed reading\u00a0 now he dedicates quite a few pages to speed reading in the book\u00a0 but for the purpose of this summary i'll so this is where you make sure that you've addressed everything\u00a0 on the agenda and within this mental model\u00a0 i think this is a great exercise to do if you're in\u00a0 if you're by yourself or in a team and the reason why i think this is a great\u00a0 mental model is because what most people do is they view\u00a0 problems from their own perspective that that one perspective and what i\u00a0 think this method allows you to do is view the problem from multiple\u00a0 different perspectives the eight intelligences\u00a0 why is it important for us to have tools to help us think in different ways nearly 100 years now so a visual learner is someone who\u00a0 prefers to learn through pictures videos and\u00a0 charts an auditory learner is someone who prefers to learn through listening\u00a0 and a kinesthetic learner is someone who prefers to have some kind of physical\u00a0 interaction or hands-on approach\u00a0 if you guys are interested in finding out what type of learner you are\u00a0 go ahead grab a copy of this book as it gives you a quiz\u00a0 that helps you find which learning style you are\u00a0 for myself i was a visual learner ordered thinking and consequences so let's say you decide that you're\u00a0 going to buy a subscription to netflix because\u00a0 everyone's using netflix and it's a cool thing to do so why not\u00a0 so this is where most people's thinking resides\u00a0 in the first order most people don't even get to that second order of\u00a0 thinking\u00a0 but let's uh let's ask ourselves and then what\u00a0 well you're going to need to get your money's worth right\u00a0 so the average netflix subscriber watches around one hour of netflix per all right so that brings us to the end of this summary guys we covered\u00a0 freeing your mind mindset\u00a0 motivation and the methods to becoming limitless\u00a0 so i hope you guys enjoyed this summary i really enjoyed\u00a0 putting it together if you did get some value out of this video please like\u00a0 comment and subscribe to the channel because it really does help guys thank\u00a0 you and if you would like me to summarize a\u00a0 book that you're interested in please don't hesitate just drop it in\u00a0 the comments below thank you so much\"", "length": 3260}

{"prompt": "Avatar of the person chatting\nI'm creating a role-playing game with some friends. The following information is a starting point: === Key === \\* World = Graniphor \\* Setting = Coast of a large continent, islands litter the water some close and some far away. The land is owned by neutral races that have achieved a balance between each other. The noble races and antagonist races have spread their conflict from their homeland to these new shores and islands. As each race gets a foothold on the islands they seek to spread ever closer to the main land and it\u2019s untold fortunes. Lots of FOMO. The islands have strange things, powers, water, ruins, technology, metals, energy. Each race has found something of value as they seek to stabilize themselves in this new land. They see enemies on the horizon and fear what marvels they\u2019ve unearthed. === Noble Races (Create societies/social structure): === \\* Human \\*\\* People of the Cloud - Worship the sky/air, closest thing to the sky are the clouds. \\*\\* Midlanders - Hearty, farming and industrial people. \\*\\* Highlanders - Warlike, small bands that keep to their own circle \\* Dwarf \\* High Elf \\* Vulcans = Volcano People- hot rock people \\* Feyleaf = Plant People \\* Beastmen = Animal-people === Antagonist Races (Destroy/Conquer to accumulate wealth or power): === \\* Goblin \\* Orc \\* Undying = created by their own doing or by someone else\u2019s, immortal, power accumulators \\* Gnoll \\* Reafton = Fish people \\* Dark Elf \\* Savage Beastmen = feral animal-people === Neutral Races (Self Interested - old): === \\* Fey = Animalistic/humanistic \\* Construct \\* Gods \\* Giants === Information === \\* Players can choose a character from three playable races: Humans, Dwarves, and Elves. \\* The player character will hail from a walk of life in a land where most people do not know about the greater world. They do not speak of the name of the world or contintent, nor do they know the lay of its land. They only know the names of mountains, and cities, and rivers. \\* There is conflict between the three playable races. Each race is an important faction. There may be smaller factions within each race, or even across races, but it is unusual. The factions exploit each other and have a delicate balance of power. They dislike each other but find they must live with each other. \\* Dwarves are exploited for their labor. Humans pursue control through conquest. \\* Dwarves drink ale and would make their own destiny if they could. \\* Woodcutting is an important profession amongst humans. \\* The world has bandits in it, and nefarious types from every race. The players come across these, but those conflicts hopefully don't end in killing. \\* When most people think of the enemy, they think of monsters and monstrous beings: the kinds of creatures that go bump in the night or live in deep dark caves. The players must fight these creatures and kill them. \\* The player characters may also occasionally fight other races, and that should be especially interesting, thematic, and suspenseful. \\* Dialog should contain suspense and indecision. \\* The story should be told from the point of view of the protagonist. \\* The protagonist is a strong female protagonist, and her name is Clara. \\* Clara is a warrior, and is a good person. \\* Clara should be conflicted and be subjected to moral quandries, and deliberate over her choices. \\* Clara is a hero. \\* The humans are ruled by a king. The human king consorts with dark elves secretly. That is scandalous. He wants something from the dark elves. There is a dark elf ambassador who has the Dragonstone. The dark elves seem to beleive the Dragonstone will let them control the other races. \\* One of the major characters is a woodcutter. \\* The orcs control a white tower. The orcs are secretly being manipulated by dark elves. Please tell me an epic, suspenseful story from the perspective of Clara. After the story, Clara will go on to have an epic, long, and world-changing quest. In the story, include lots of foreshadowing of the events that are to come. Involve the woodcutter, orcs, the dark elf ambassador, and the human king in the story.\n\nClara was a warrior, one of the strongest among her people. She had been born and raised in the land of the humans, where her father had been a great warrior in his time. But Clara was different from the other humans. She had a sense of justice, and was always willing to help those in need.\n\nOne day, while out on patrol, Clara came across a woodcutter being attacked by a group of orcs. She leapt into action, using her sword and her skill to quickly dispatch the orcs. The woodcutter, grateful for her help, introduced himself as Alistair.\n\nClara and Alistair struck up a conversation, and Clara learned that he was on a mission to deliver a special piece of wood to the human king. She offered to help him, and they set out together.\n\nAs they traveled, they came across many dangers, including other orcs and even a dark elf ambassador. But Clara was always ready, and she fought bravely to protect Alistair and his valuable cargo.\n\nWhen they finally reached the human king's castle, they were greeted by the king himself. But Clara quickly realized that something was not right. The king seemed to be consorting with the dark elves, and he seemed to have an ulterior motive for wanting the wood that Alistair had brought.\n\nClara was filled with unease and indecision. She didn't know what to do, but she knew that she couldn't simply stand by and do nothing. She decided to trust her instincts and confront the king, demanding to know what was going on.\n\nThe king, caught off guard, revealed that he had been secretly working with the dark elves to gain control over the other races. He wanted to use the wood that Alistair had brought to create a powerful weapon, one that would let him dominate the other races.\n\nClara was horrified, and she knew that she had to stop the king's plans. She fought bravely, using all of her skill and strength to defeat the king and his dark elf allies. In the end, she emerged victorious, and the threat to the other races was averted.\n\nBut Clara knew that this was only the beginning. She had foreseen a great and epic quest, one that would take her across the world and change the course of history. She was ready for whatever came next, knowing that she would always stand up for what was right.\n\nAvatar of the person chatting\nThat was great. Tell me that story again, but add dialog and suspense. Spend more time building up the drama before revealing that the king is in cahoots with the dark elves. Make it harder for Clara to learn these secrets. Show me some of the ordeals and trials that she has to go through.\n\nClara and Alistair walked through the forest, their footsteps quiet on the soft earth. They had been traveling for days, and Clara could sense that they were getting close to their destination.\n\n\"Alistair, what exactly is this wood that you're delivering to the king?\" Clara asked, curiosity getting the better of her.\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure,\" Alistair replied, \"but I know it's very valuable. The king is willing to pay a handsome sum for it.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Clara said, her mind racing. She didn't like the idea of delivering something valuable to the king without knowing what it was. But she had promised to help Alistair, and she was a woman of her word.\n\nAs they continued on their journey, they encountered more and more dangers. They fought off orcs and dark elves, and even came across a group of savage beastmen. Clara fought bravely, using her sword and her wits to keep herself and Alistair safe.\n\nBut despite the obstacles in their way, they eventually reached the castle of the human king. Clara could feel a sense of unease growing inside her as they approached the imposing structure. Something didn't feel right.\n\nWhen they were finally ushered into the king's presence, Clara could see that her instincts had been correct. The king was in cahoots with the dark elves, and he had an ulterior motive for wanting the wood that Alistair had brought.\n\n\"So, you've finally arrived,\" the king said, his voice dripping with malice. \"I've been waiting for you, Alistair. And you, Clara. I've heard a lot about you. You're quite the warrior.\"\n\n\"What do you want with us?\" Clara demanded, her hand on the hilt of her sword.\n\n\"Oh, I think you know,\" the king said, a sly smile spreading across his face. \"I want the wood that Alistair has brought. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get it.\"\n\n\"I won't let you have it,\" Clara said, her voice firm. \"Whatever your plans are, I won't allow them to come to fruition.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" the king sneered, gesturing to his guards. \"Take them away. I'll deal with them later.\"\n\nClara and Alistair were dragged away, thrown into a dark, damp cell deep within the castle. Clara knew that they had to escape, but she didn't know how. She was filled with doubt and uncertainty.\n\nBut she refused to give up. She used her skills as a warrior to pick the lock on their cell, and she and Alistair managed to escape. They made their way back to the king's throne room, where they found the king and the dark elf ambassador waiting for them.\n\n\"You fools,\" the king spat. \"You think you can defeat me? I have the power of the dark elves on my side. I have the Dragonstone, and with it, I can control the other races.\"\n\n\"Not if I have anything to say about it,\" Clara said, drawing her sword.\n\nThe battle that ensued was fierce and intense. Clara fought with all her might, using every ounce of skill and strength she possessed. She and Alistair were outnumbered, but they refused to give up.\n\nIn the end, they emerged victorious. The king and the dark elf ambassador were defeated, and the threat to the other races was averted. Clara was exhausted, but she felt a sense of pride and satisfaction. She had done what was right, and she had\n\nAvatar of the person chatting\nIt's problematic for the kingdom for the king to be defeated. Tell me that story again, but incorporate more realpolitik, and make the king more machiavellian.\n\nClara and Alistair walked through the forest, their footsteps quiet on the soft earth. They had been traveling for days, and Clara could sense that they were getting close to their destination.\n\n\"Alistair, what exactly is this wood that you're delivering to the king?\" Clara asked, curiosity getting the better of her.\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure,\" Alistair replied, \"but I know it's very valuable.

Is your thirst for power really worth that?\"\n\nThe king sneered at her. \"You don't understand the ways of realpolitik, Clara. In this world, the strong survive and the weak perish. I will do whatever it takes to ensure the survival and dominance of the human race.\"\n\nClara was disgusted by the king's words, but she knew that she had to stop him.

It\u2019s cutting into employees\u2019 ability to get real work done.\n\nContext: \n# 5 reasons canceling meetings is a terrible idea for startups\nCreativity and collaboration soar when you bring the right people together in a meeting.\n\nShopify\u2019s decision to cancel all meetings with more than two employees has drawn a lot of criticism over the past 48 hours. It\u2019s an interesting move that Shopify claims will result in over 10,000 calendar events being removed each year. But if you are a founder running a startup, should you adopt a similar policy?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nMeetups are a powerful tool for startup founders. Used correctly they should inspire attendees and are an effective way to collect difficult feedback. Instead of canceling meetings, founders should focus on creating strong agendas for meetings that provide engaging and inspiring content for attendees.\n\nChoosing to cancel the meeting can have several negative consequences:\n\n\\*\\*mission misalignment\\*\\*\nNo one reads email or Slack messages or other forms of written content properly. To deal with the incredible amount of information we receive daily, we skim. If you want your message to be absorbed and understood, you need to get in front of your audience and deliver that message directly to them. Then follow up in writing.\n\nFailure to communicate frequently with your team leaves room for misalignment. Assumptions are made about the direction of the company. Major policies are interpreted differently. Rumors start spreading. Not everyone is pulling in the same direction.\n\nAs the leaders of your organization, founders need to be visible and provide a consistent and confident presence. This gives employees the confidence to do their best and take advantage of the relative autonomy of working in a startup.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that your team will never fully understand the exact strategy you have in mind unless you communicate it to them on an ongoing basis. Team meetings are the perfect forum to continuously communicate the company\u2019s strategy.\n\n\\*\\*no real-time feedback\\*\\*\n\nFacial expressions tell a lot about what a person is thinking. The ability to give some information and then see how your team reacts in real time is completely lost without the meeting. Employees are unlikely to message you to say \u2018\\_this is a stupid idea\\_\u2018, but it\u2019s hard to hide how they react when you\u2019re talking to them.\n\nWithout meetings, we create discord between the team and the founders. Very few people will actively respond if they don\u2019t need to \u2013 so why take the risk? But in a room, those barriers can be lowered and useful feedback can flow far more easily.\n\n\\*\\*weak social ties\\*\\*\n\nMeetings are not just about meetings. It\u2019s about fist bumps, handshakes, or hugs upon arrival. Personal catch-up \u2013 \u2018\\_How is the family?\\_\u2018 \u2013 remind us that we are all humans and not just units working in a machine. Bio breaks where we bump into someone we haven\u2019t talked to in a while. and the occasion, especially prevalent in Britain, to go to a pub to drink afterwards.\n\nMeetings create time for team engagement that builds relationships between members. A team that enjoys spending time together is more likely to work a few extra hours, go the extra mile to help a coworker, and be committed to their work.\n\nWhile the world has changed significantly over the years, fundamental human behavior has not, and engaged teams will always outperform teams that are not.\n\n\\*\\*unknown culture war\\*\\*\n\nSome of your team may be happy if you cancel the meeting. Others will feel isolated and they are missing out on interacting with their partners which gives them energy.\n\nCanceling meetings creates an unbalanced culture that favors a more introverted personality type and excludes people who prefer to spend time together in person. By extension, this makes it very difficult to create and develop a balanced company culture where everyone feels like they belong.\n\n\\*\\*low employee visibility\\*\\*\n\nWe all want to be seen. We want to celebrate all successes. The cancellation of meetings removes a powerful platform for founders to recognize the achievements of their teams which in turn can generate a significant amount of goodwill.\n\nStartup founders often look to larger companies to learn how to lead their organizations. In this case, large companies have dynamics so different from smaller startups that replicating their practices would be a mistake. To overcome obstacles and change the world, startup founders need to build teams that are aligned, engaged, motivated, inspired, passionate and committed. This cannot be done without meetings.\n\n###\n# How Amazon conducts meetings\n\nAmazon is well known for its lack of using PowerPoint. The way this works is that before a meeting, you print out enough copies for everyone in the room. You\u2019re not allowed to read the document from your computer unless you are remote. Also, no one reads the document before the meeting. You are usually given 20\u201325 minutes at the beginning of a 60-minute meeting to read the doc from beginning to end. Most people write down questions or feedback directly on the printout since using a computer during this time is frowned upon.\n\nAll print outs are handed back to you at the end of the meeting. The rest of the time consists of everyone in the room challenging your position, questioning your tactics, and digging through the data to make sure it is valid. It\u2019s incredibly stressful, and when the meeting is over, it\u2019s your responsibility to update and recirculate the document to everyone as a final version. There is no ideation or brainstorming during these kinds of meetings. You need to go into them with everything prepared ahead of time, which usually means you\u2019ve had multiple people review it to ensure that you are ready.\n\nThe last thing you should know, which is perhaps the most critical part of the entire process, is that your 6-pager needs to stand on its own. One of the things I admired most at Amazon was their ability to transfer knowledge between different groups. Any time I interacted with a new group, I could ask to see their OP doc and get caught up on everything I needed to know. For this process to work, it means you need to write your 6-pager in a way that allows anyone, even people not familiar with the subject, to know what is going on without additional research. I\u2019ll get into some of the ways you can do that later.\n\nSince this may be your first time reading an Amazon-style 6-pager, the last bit of context I\u2019ll give you is that I wrote this for a game development tool I have been building in my spare time called\u00a0[Pixel Vision 8](https://www.pixelvision8.com/). There are a few things I dived deeper into than I would in a normal 6-pager to help make things a bit clearer. Also, some sections are more generic than I\u2019d typically write, seeing how this isn\u2019t a real plan I can execute on for a hobby project. Still, it was a good exercise in focusing my activities over the next six months. Writing a plan like this is one of the most powerful ways you can organize your thoughts to share with others.\n\nAfter you finish reading the 6-pager, I\u2019ll break apart each section and explain them in more detail. Don\u2019t get too hung up on the actual contents if you\u2019re not familiar with game development, marketing, or reading dense plans. I also won\u2019t accept any feedback on this one, so there is no need to print it out and hand it back to me.\n# Shopify tells employees to just say no to meetings\nShopify Inc spent last year cutting costs. Now, it\u2019s cutting meetings.\n\nAs employees return from holiday break, the Canadian ecommerce firm said it\u2019s conducting a \u201ccalendar purge\u201d, removing all recurring meetings with more than two people \u201cin perpetuity\u201d, while reupping a rule that no meetings at all can be held on Wednesdays. Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week. The company\u2019s leaders will also encourage workers to decline other meetings, and remove themselves from large internal chat groups.\n\n\u201cThe best thing founders can do is subtraction,\u201d chief executive officer Tobi Lutke, who co-founded the company, said in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to add things than to remove things. If you say yes to a thing, you actually say no to every other thing you could have done with that period of time. As people add things, the set of things that can be done becomes smaller. Then, you end up with more and more people just maintaining the status quo.\u201d\n\nLarge, long and unproductive meetings have become a scourge of today\u2019s hybrid workplace, prompting companies to try and curtail them. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc, household product maker Clorox Co and tech firm Twilio Inc are among those that have instituted no-meeting days. Employees spend about 18 hours a week on average in meetings, according to a survey conducted last year, and they only decline 14% of invites even though they\u2019d prefer to back out of 31% of them. Reluctantly going to noncritical meetings wastes about US$100mil (RM440.50mil) a year at big organisations, the survey found.\n\nPoorly managed meetings can also hurt employee engagement and even boost their intention to quit, according to Steven Rogelberg, a professor of organisational science, psychology and management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Data from Microsoft Corp based on thousands of users of its workplace software found that time spent in meetings more than tripled in the first two years of the pandemic, and the number of weekly meetings more than doubled.\n\nThe share of virtual meetings that are one-on-one, though, increased from 17% in 2020 to 42% last year, a study of 48 million meetings from collaboration analytics firm Vyopta found, a sign that companies are trying to rein in participants. Shopify said that a bot will serve as the policy\u2019s enforcer, reminding meeting organisers of the new rules starting Jan 5.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen excess meetings creep back into our day to day,\u201d Kaz Nejatian, Shopify\u2019s vice president of product and chief operating officer, said in an emailed reply to questions. \u201cWe know no one joined Shopify to sit in meetings.\u201d\n\nThe meeting purge is the latest workforce experiment from Shopify. In May 2020, soon after the pandemic hit, Shopify went \u201cdigital by design\u201d, letting all employees work from anywhere indefinitely. Last year, amid industry volatility that battered shares of technology companies, Shopify changed its compensation practices to let staff decide how much of their pay will be cash versus equity, rather than having management decide the mix.\n\nThe latest changes come amid a cost-cutting drive at the company, which lets merchants set up websites for online sales, allowing them to manage inventory and process payments, along with tools for in-store purchases. It was among the hottest pandemic stocks as online shopping boomed and became Canada\u2019s most valuable company, but the shares plummeted 75% last year. Shopify cut about 1,000 jobs from its workforce of 10,000 over the summer as Lutke acknowledged that he overestimated the pandemic\u2019s impact on ecommerce.\n\nNo-meeting policies can boost productivity and reduce employee stress, according to research from France\u2019s NEOMA Business School. But meetings aren\u2019t disappearing entirely at Shopify. The company said there will be a \u201ctwo-week cooling off period\u201d before anyone can reconvene a canceled meeting. It will only use Slack as an instant messenger from now on, with \u201clarge, unwieldy\u201d chat groups used only for announcements, it said. \u2013 Bloomberg", "length": 3355}
{"prompt": "Summarize the following.\nTitle: \"Become a LinkedIn Search Ninja: Advanced Boolean Search | Talent Connect London 2014 - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"is everybody ready to begin okay does anybody interested in about how to get more value out of LinkedIn from search yes is it the whole full belly syndrome you just as just eight okay so the first thing I'll say is that there should be some time at the end for questions there's two mics in the aisles so don't be shy if you have questions and also if there's something that's burning that you want to mention in the middle you can interrupt me just just icky late wildly and I'll call on you and I'll repeat the question for other folks so I am Glen Kathy I work for kforce it's a us-based staffing firm about 1.2 billion in revenue I also oversee the senior vice president of talent acquisition there and we have a national recruiting center with about 300 recruiters in it and I also manage some very specialized recruiting teams one of which is focused heavily on big data and data scientists and things like that so I'm still very much in the trenches trying to find and attract the right people so if you are a fan of taken like I am I just replaced one word in here it's certainly not as violent as the taken movie but I like to kick it off by asking you do you guys know what the most common activity is that anybody performs on LinkedIn is I think I heard somebody say job search profile views yes searching for and finding people that's the number one activity that anybody by the way not just you guys but other folks are doing on LinkedIn and so my question to you is when you want to be actually very good at it if that's what everybody else is doing you always have to ask yourself the question what are you doing that other people are not sometimes the tough answer to that is nothing which means you have no competitive advantage even if you're using the same resource like LinkedIn so I also hopefully won't disappoint people even though the title of this was talking about advanced boolean search I actually believe that the most advanced aspect of searching any source of human capital data and when it comes to professional data LinkedIn is the number one they have more data than anybody else professionally it actually has very little to do with boolean logic it has a lot more to do with your mind so even though we'll cover some boolean basics today I'm not really going to go over and or a not and all the other fun stuff it's syntactically unless you guys have specific questions about that which I'd be happy to answer this is going to set the stage for the entire talk that I have today which is you have to learn how to ask the right questions which when you when you realize it the searches that you're running a LinkedIn they're really their queries which are really formal statements of your information needs you're really asking LinkedIn do you have these people but I find that most people don't ask very sophisticated questions of LinkedIn but LinkedIn is capable of answering sophisticated questions and the sophistication has nothing to do with boolean logic it has to do with everything else you put in your search so it's all about asking the right questions so we'll remember that as a theme today so has anybody seen the movie Inception yeah even if you haven't you're not raising your hand if you haven't I would definitely I would definitely recommend watching it that I believe is Paris and you know in this scene Leonardo DiCaprio is actually watching the city Bend the reason why I have to slide in here is because what you are capable of doing with LinkedIn is actually only limited by your own mind it has again nothing to do with boolean logic and actually really nothing to do with LinkedIn it's your capacity to think creatively and ask the right questions so I wanted to set the stage with that today so the first round of questions that I'm going to ask you and if you're shy you don't wanna yell it out that's fine I'll probably answer for you but can you guys tell me why the average person joins LinkedIn they may ever wonder about that what's that okay maybe they're missing out on something they want to belong to something obviously they're getting a critical mass networking right okay there why do you think I'm asking you this question do you guys know okay so this though it might be a slightly Epiphanius moment for some of you in the room it's that if you don't first understand why people are joining LinkedIn you won't really understand why they may or may not say certain things in their profile and if they don't say certain things in their profile and you search for it can you find them No so I'm actually the guy that coined that phrase dark matter so I'm also a blogger I have a blog called boolean black belt I write a lot about information retrieval searching recruiting and recruiting things like that and the concept of dark matter has to do with people that are on LinkedIn that are there but you can't find because your search excludes them so when you take the person who joins LinkedIn to network but there's not looking for a job how much information do you think the average person puts in their LinkedIn profile a lot or a little it's a little sometimes it's very little and I'll show you a couple of examples of that so if they're using it for networking not looking for jobs they're not filling out their LinkedIn profile like a CV many do but most don't you have to understand this first because if you don't first understand that you will have no clue as to why when you run searches you find people but you may be completely oblivious to the fact that you might be missing out on 80% of who you could be finding now when it comes to who you can recruit on LinkedIn this is a really interesting study they actually did this and I think over it was 18,000 people in 26 countries of people that were fully employed if you look at the percentages it really technically says that 85% of people should be open to hearing from you that's how I interpret this so I could care less that 25 percent are kind of looking I think anybody's a candidate but I just wanted you to take a second and understand that up to 85 percent of people should be open to your outreach effort even if they didn't join LinkedIn look to look for a job even if they don't have a CV level profile if you have any audio on that if not I'll try to remember what this lady was saying at a LinkedIn event she's basically telling she's actually talking to folks at linkedin about hey i've got software engineers at my company that i tried to not only get onto linkedin but also ask them to fill out their profiles and when she talks to these software engin it's keyboard frequency right there's a whole bunch of other things going on but you're never really going to get away from keyword frequency so now that I've walked you down the step of you have a lot of people that join LinkedIn they're not necessarily looking right it doesn't mean you can't recruit them and there are some people that actually try to make themselves a little bit more difficult to find do you think that the average search pulls up most people it actually pulls up what I would call the kind of in mail response rates do you think those do you get from those people lower high it's probably low right these are the people that are the hottest guys and the girls right so they're everybody hitting on them and eventually did you start turning cold on everybody you get the low response rates what i want you to understand though is if you start thinking outside the box and running some different queries you might actually get a higher response rate from your in males and find people that literally have never received a message even in one city so then the question becomes well there's another example of dark matter if you just retrieved 600 results and you look through 100 results you've actually not looked at the other 500 and you might be asking will go a night I don't have a lot of time I'm busy I carry a rec load of I don't know from 20 to 30 to 40 recs at a time if that sounds familiar the challenge is you now know that you're leaving the majority of people behind that you never look at I'm going to talk to you a little bit later today times it gets people thinking too narrowly but what we're looking for here is a salesperson the lower left-hand corner is a top producer in sales the upper right-hand corner would be a substation engineer as an example and the bottom is actually I think just an interesting way of asking for an analyst a business analyst without actually looking for any exact phrases you could put that in the title field I call this maximum inclusion because you have to understand that for anything that you're looking for there's going to be more saying LinkedIn can you can you find me people that have cloud experience and LinkedIn if it could ask a question would say what does cloud experience look like and that's I would say well this this or statement basically means cloud and it's gonna run it and it's gonna find people no matter how they say it now granted if you were paying attention earlier you might realize yeah there's gonna be some people with cloud experience that don't say anything about cloud no matter how you might think they this happens after you run your search if you're not familiar with it you can't do it up front you run your search then you go to the results page and on the left hand rail you can start typing in things so what I started typing in was the word Java and I found all these groups so if you're looking at that you know you're getting close to a thousand people that are software engineers that don't mention Java that are in Java groups is it a hundred percent likely that all these people are Java within quotes on LinkedIn and you just have to start thinking well if I was looking for device design professional what are the types of things that that person might put on their profile again assuming that they're gonna have a profile with a bunch of words on it so we do a couple phrases here medical device design designing medical devices design medical devices now that's just my first search I'm going to apply my technique of iterative search after this because I'm gonna scan probably I'll be honest with and that's why it's like talking about dark matter that's like I'm telling you guys there's millions of people that you're excluding how would you even know it because LinkedIn won't say hey here's 400 people but you missed 1200 it doesn't tell you that you have to think first and say my search found some but I know I probably excluded some so how can I go back and refine my search is to start to increasingly shed light on the people that my first search is eliminated you have to be aware that if other profile does that mean they're bad these are the things that you excluded because you run searches with too many keywords I always say go keyword rich first and then go keyword poor second my point is most people don't even run searches to be able to pull this person up that is the totality of that person's profile how many times do you think someone reaches out to that person on LinkedIn very little if at all it's like hidden treasure I love it some other interesting things so you have to think strategically excluded EMC so I came up with Bret Walker from the profile on the left and I placed him at EMC and that was a long time ago and I double-checked because whenever I use this guy's an example I'm actually hoping that he never leaves EMC because you can see he was a pretty good placement right he started there in April 2006 and he's been there ever since and I love this story because it's all from a search for someone who didn't even say the primary skill that was required and what was function right then put it in word use my little trick snapped it into a giant war statement it takes a couple clicks done and you run that search and that pulls up 4.3 million people so that's not bad that's actually 67% of the women in the UK on LinkedIn so two-thirds right but because I'm here in the UK and we don't want to just use popular names in the US this probably took me 30 minutes of research is what I did next so what I did is I went to there was no single webs so the United States it was easy it was target them elsewhere to reach out to them to try to bring them back does anybody look for expats a handful of people I wanted to put there on purpose because I was told that that would be something of help but again it's not about me giving you the answer it's about you me giving you the spark of the notion of what would be on someone's profile of someone who lived in your home country that it moved abroad targeting them and abroad groups are also a good way to find them because there's a lot of people that join local people with text poor LinkedIn profiles and you have to be able to create queries to find them you're gonna have to use what I call strategic exclusion which is excluding the most common terms talent mapping if you ever run a search like this in a city and it's a relatively basic search and basic searches aren't bad they're just basic so I'm looking for a project manager with finance right super basic search but I'm actually pulling up almost 4,000 people now no one's gonna look at 4,000 tag them as so many different things you can do that will aid your ability to retrieve them later very precisely so look into the custom fields I don't know if anybody will actually get this humor I won't explain it so if somebody actually gets this just approached me after the session so I'm going to call this Drake style sourcing so instead of starting from the top I'm gonna start from the bottom of the search results so if I got nine hundred and fifty nine Mechanical Engineers in a particular good people you saw some of the names of the people that came up with the minimalist profiles the first thing I would do is roll my dice on companies so if they work for a reputable company that other people have alrea\"", "length": 3181}

They protect me, from others, sometimes, and sometimes from myself.\n\nTherapist: They are so attuned to you that they recognize when you need something, and they do their absolute best to provide for your needs. And they know just the right ways to be with you so you feel secure and safe.\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nTherapist: And you can notice what it is about them that makes it so very clear that they cherish you so much. Perhaps it\u2019s a gleam in their eyes. They delight in you being you.\n\nPatient: They smile, they laugh, they pat me on the head . . . they\u2019re not real . . . they\u2019re . . . perfect . . . they\u2019re too perfect. This isn\u2019t real. They seem almost plastic. I can feel their love and can see their support, and love, and affection and caring about me, but it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s too good to be true. It\u2019s a sinking feeling. I can\u2019t do this anymore . . . this is just faking.\n\nTherapist: They see, and they understand that it seems that way to you. They understand that at first it can be hard to really take in their deep and unconditional love. They protect you, and they protect you from yourself sometimes, and this is one of those circumstances in which they help to protect you from doubting too much, from doubting that what you most want and need is here for you. Notice how they respond to knowing that you feel this is fake and that it\u2019s too good to be true.\n\nPatient: They brush it off; they put their arms around me, reassure me. They take it as a compliment that I experience them as too good to be true.\n\nTherapist: Yes. They\u2019re so happy that their intention to be the best possible parents for you touches you as it does.\n\nPatient: It feels complete, it feels whole, it makes me feel I\u2019m part of something that is what was meant to be.\n\nTherapist: Yes. It was meant to be that you be valued and loved for exactly who you are. Really take that in. Feeling appreciated and valued and loved. Feel it in your body.\n\nPatient: It\u2019s still too perfect. This isn\u2019t real. I can\u2019t accept it.\n\nTherapist: These parents recognize that it\u2019s still hard for you to accept. They\u2019re very patient, and it adds to their resolve to show you how much they value, and cherish you . . . Even amidst it being hard to accept, you have moments of really feeling and taking in the perfection of it . . . of feeling the completeness of it, the wholeness of it . . . of their reassurance and support, their guidance and their protection. And in those moments of perfection, you know that you\u2019re part of something that was meant to be.\n\nPatient: They\u2019re wise. They understand. They\u2019ve experienced it.\n\nTherapist: Yes, they\u2019ve been there, so they understand what you\u2019re going through, and they know how to support you in all the right ways for you.\n\nAt the beginning of this session, the patient was very engaged with the imagery and the process and generated a vivid, positive interaction with the parent figures. Then doubt emerged. It is notable that at first, even amidst doubt, he continued to experience the positive affect and ways of being of the parents:\n\nThis isn\u2019t real. They seem almost plastic. I can feel their love and can see their support, and love, and affection and caring about me, but it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s too good to be true.\n\nThen he withdrew from the frame: \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore . . . this is just faking.\u201d The therapist maintained the presence of the frame by noting that the parent figures recognized and understood his doubt.\n\n186 Even though of course the IPF frame is \u201cfake,\u201d the therapist supported the patient\u2019s return to suspension of disbelief by suggesting that the parent figures understood that \u201cit seems that way\u201d (i.e., fake) to him.\n\nToward the same goal of reviving the patient\u2019s engagement with the frame, the therapist incorporated what the patient had earlier said about the parents protecting him, sometimes from himself:\n\nThey protect you, and they protect you from yourself sometimes, and this is one of those circumstances in which they help to protect you from doubting too much, from doubting that what you most want and need is here for you.\n\nBy combining speaking from the frame with highlighting something that the patient had said about the parent figures when he was engaged with the frame, the therapist enhanced the possibility that the patient would reengage with the parent figure imagery and directly experience that engagement. He then invited such direct experience: \u201cNotice how they respond to knowing that you feel this is fake and that it\u2019s too good to be true.\u201d This intervention was effective, as the patient himself incorporated his doubt and withdrawal into the imagery:\n\nThey brush it off; they put their arms around me, reassure me. They take it as a compliment that I experience them as too good to be true.\n\nHis reengagement, however, was short-lived. After the therapist\u2019s response to the patient\u2019s very significant experience of completeness, wholeness, and of being \u201cpart of something that is what was meant to be,\u201d the patient stepped back: \u201cIt\u2019s still too perfect. This isn\u2019t real. I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d Again the therapist pointed back to the frame, suggesting, in response to the patient\u2019s saying he \u201ccan\u2019t accept\u201d the frame and the experiences within it, that the parents \u201crecognize that it\u2019s still hard for you to accept.\u201d \u201cStill hard\u201d honors the patient\u2019s experience of difficulty and suggests that his difficulty does not mean that he cannot accept the frame and the positive experiences within it.\n\nThe frame was reinforced further by the therapist\u2019s incorporation and mirroring not only of the positive experiences the patient had expressed prior to the frame ruptures, but also his experiences of both engagement and disengagement with the frame:\n\nEven amidst it being hard to accept, you have moments of really feeling and taking in the perfection of it . . . of feeling the completeness of it, the wholeness of it . . . of their reassurance and support, their guidance and their protection. And in those moments of perfection, you know that you\u2019re part of something that was meant to be.\n\nThe IPF session ended with the patient feeling a supportive, loving connection with the imagined parents. During the next three sessions he also experienced intermittent withdrawal from the IPF frame, and each time the therapist\u2019s pointing to the parent figures\u2019 responses reengaged the patient with the frame. In subsequent sessions, he maintained his connection with the frame, but within the frame he several times indicated some wariness and mistrust about the parent figures.\n\nMistrust or emotional distancing from the parent figures. It is quite common for patients to be engaged with the IPF imagery frame but to experience guardedness or uncertainty about the parent figures\u2019 trustworthiness or reliability. One such expression was presented in the clinical vignette on pages 314\u2013315:\n\nPatient: I\u2019m not really sure I can trust them.\n\nTherapist: They see that you\u2019re not really sure, and they understand that. They\u2019re very patient, knowing that as you\u2019re with them more and more, you\u2019ll get to see that they\u2019re there to protect you and to be attuned to you and your needs, and you\u2019ll see from your own experience whether you\u2019ll choose to trust them.\n\nThe commentary about this interchange on page 316 explicates how the therapist \u201cseamlessly incorporated the patient\u2019s experience of doubt into the imagery process.\u201d\n\nAnother patient was guarded against the imagined parents:\n\nPatient: They\u2019re there, but I don\u2019t really want to open up to them. They kind of have to prove themselves to me first, that they won\u2019t make fun of me.\n\n187 Therapist: Of course you need to take your time, to see for yourself whether you can really trust them to not make fun of you. They know that too, and they won\u2019t push you to open up before you\u2019re ready. Notice how it is they are with you, and notice how they are with you that begins to let you know that they accept you and love you for who you are, no matter what you open up to them about. And just when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll start to feel that sense of trust and safety with them.\n\nHere, the therapist acknowledged and validated the patient\u2019s experience and indicated that the parent figures did the same. Using the patient\u2019s words and phrases (\u201cmake fun of,\u201d \u201cto open up\u201d), she suggested that the parent figures were attuned to and accepted the patient\u2019s guardedness and that they would be in some way that the patient would experience as promoting trust and a sense of safety. As always, the therapist did not suggest how the parent figures would be, but left it up to the patient\u2019s inner knowing of what was needed.\n\nUncomfortable affective states. As parents\u2019 reliable and effective soothing and reassurance when a child is affectively distressed promotes secure attachment, during IPF sessions the therapist watches for signs of distress in the patient and suggests that the parent figures \u201cfind just the right ways\u201d to provide soothing and reassurance. The therapist aims to be attuned to the patient\u2019s changes of state, which will likely occur before the patient reports them or even before the patient is aware of them.\n\nNonverbal indications of a change of state might include a sudden frown or other facial expression shift, the appearance of tears, an increase in body movement, or a change in breathing rate or pattern. In the following example, the therapist brought a change she noticed into the IPF frame:\n\nTherapist: These parents are so attuned to you, and they see now from the expression on your face that something has shifted in you. They have a sense of exactly what you need right now. Notice how they are with you that provides you with exactly what you need to help you with what\u2019s happening in you right now. They find just the right ways to soothe and reassure you about what it is you\u2019re feeling.\n\nHere, the therapist did not know what the affective experience was but trusted the information from the patient\u2019s face and, in pointing to the parent figures\u2019 attunement, trusted that the patient\u2019s inner knowing of what she needed would appear in how the parent figures responded to her. The patient experienced both the therapist\u2019s and the parent figures\u2019 attunement as well as the soothing and reassurance that appeared in the imagery.\n\nWhen the patient reports an affective shift, either within or outside the imagery frame, the therapist names the state that the patient has reported. For example:\n\nPatient: I\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m afraid now that they won\u2019t like me.\n\nTherapist: They see now that you\u2019ve become afraid, afraid that they won\u2019t like you. They know how uncomfortable that you must feel, feeling that fear. And they find just the right ways to reassure you, that they like and love you no matter what. Notice now how they reassure you.\n\nPatient: They tell me that they love me.\n\nTherapist: Yes, and you can really take that in, that they love you so much, no matter what. Really feel what that\u2019s like as you take that in.\n\nPatient: I feel a little better, like they will like me.\n\nTherapist: Yes. They will like you, no matter what. And that feels better, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nIn the following example, the patient reported an affective shift and kept it in the IPF frame herself:\n\nPatient: I\u2019m feeling angry at them. I want to see what they do.\n\nTherapist: Yes, let yourself feel angry, and see how they are with you as you feel that.\n\nPatient: They listen to why I\u2019m angry. They don\u2019t laugh at me for being angry. They take my emotions seriously.\n\nTherapist: Yes, they take everything about you seriously, with respect and care and concern.\n\nPatient: They don\u2019t leave.\n\nTherapist: They stay right with you.\n\nPatient: I have the feeling that they\u2019re respectful of my feelings.\n\nAfter the IPF session, the patient spoke of her childhood experience of her actual mother often laughing", "length": 3120}
{"prompt": "at her when she was angry and when she was upset about being teased.\n\nIf a patient is so emotionally upset that he or she is unable to respond to and within the imagined scene in the IPF frame, the therapist may suggest that the entire scene will change:\n\nPatient: No, it\u2019s just too painful. They can\u2019t help me.\n\nTherapist: They\u2019re so very present with you, and so patient and resourceful. They find just the right way to help you with these feelings.\n\nPatient: No, they\u2019re not helping; they\u2019re just looking at me.\n\nTherapist: And now this scene will fade away and a new scene will appear to you. In this new scene, you\u2019re still feeling upset, and this time your ideal parents are being with you in just the right ways for what you need right now. Notice how these parents are being with you in this new scene, in all the ways that help you with these painful feelings.\n\nPatient: (pause of about 15 seconds) We\u2019re all together on the sofa now. My mother is pulling me close to her, and my father is telling me I\u2019m going to be all right.\n\nTherapist: Yes. What effect does that have on your emotional state?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel more calm. Like maybe they can help me.\n\nTherapist: Yes, more calm, and they help you feel better.\n\nThe therapist\u2019s action of suggesting a scene change reflects attunement to the patient\u2019s distress and her inability to receive relief from the current scene, protection from prolonged exposure to the distress and the lack of help, and soothing by pointing to a new scene in which the patient is able to experience some relief.\n\nSUGGEST CHANGES IN SCENES OR NEW SCENES WITH THE IDEAL PARENT FIGURES\n\nThe creation of changes in scenes with ideal parent figures can be very beneficial, and not just in response to a patient having difficulty in a particular imagined scene. In an IPF session, after some time with a scene in which the patient experiences ideal parent figures in a positive way, the therapist may suggest either that something within the current scene will change or that a new and different scene will emerge. In either form, the therapist suggests that the patient will continue to experience attachment-promoting qualities from the parent figures, and that the change will highlight such qualities even more clearly and perhaps in different ways.\n\nSuch shifts reinforce the consolidation of representations of positive attachment experiences by generalizing them across various and changing situations and contexts. They also provide the patient with the opportunity to project additional attachment-promoting qualities onto the parent figures, either generated spontaneously by the patient or suggested by the therapist.\n\nChanges within scenes. As the letting go of a scene and creating a new scene requires more imaginative effort and pliancy, it is best during early IPF sessions to only suggest changes within scenes. A possible wording for such a suggestion is as follows:\n\nTherapist: And now something in this scene will change. Something will change so that you\u2019ll experience these parents as even more supportive of you feeling absolutely secure in your connection with them. As something in the scene changes, notice what it is that happens that brings you an even clearer sense of comfort and security with them. And when you\u2019re ready, you can tell me what\u2019s different and what that\u2019s like for you.\n\nThe open wording leaves the creation of the specific parental ways of being to the patient\u2019s knowing of what he or she most needs for building feelings of security. In the example below, the therapist suggested several attachment-promoting qualities that were positive opposites of the adjectives the patient used to describe his actual parents. So far in the IPF sessions, he had not included these in experiences of his imagined parent figures.\n\nTherapist: Keeping with you all the good feelings that you feel from being with these parents, now something in the scene will change, and you\u2019ll notice now how calm [tense] these parents are, and how happy [depressed] and fully present [distracted] they are with you. They\u2019re happy to put aside their own issues so they can be with you in all the ways that help you to feel absolutely secure in the relationship with them. As something changes about the scene, you\u2019ll find that you can really take in\n\n189 how it feels that they\u2019re with you in these ways.\n\nChanges of scenes. After the patient has had several constructive IPF sessions and has been able to shift within scenes for additional positive experiences with the parent figures, the therapist may suggest changes of scenes. The format of the suggestions is similar to those above, with slight wording changes. In the example below, the patient is given the freedom to project specific qualities onto the parent figures in the new scene:\n\nTherapist: And now let this scene fade away, and as you continue to feel the good feelings of connection with these parents, a new scene is about to appear. In this new scene, you\u2019re also with your ideal parents, and they\u2019re being with you in ways that bring you even more feelings of security. Now this new scene is getting clearer and clearer. Notice how it is that they\u2019re being with you that helps you to feel absolutely secure in your relationship with them.\n\nSpecific qualities can also be suggested as appearing in the parent figures in the new scene:\n\nTherapist: As you continue to feel the benefits of being with these parents in the ways they\u2019re being with you, this particular scene will now fade away, and a new scene with your ideal parents is about to appear. In this new scene, in which you\u2019re also feeling in close connection with these parents, they are so very warm [cold] and easygoing [strained] toward you. And something about them will let you know that you can begin to get a sense of how trustworthy [not trustworthy] they are in your connection with them.\n\nTiming of suggesting scene changes. In addition to the principle that suggesting changes in scenes is done several times before suggesting changes of scenes, the choice of when during a session to suggest a change in or of a scene is based on several factors. The most obvious time to make a change, as described in the previous section, is when the patient is having difficulty that the parent figures are not able to help with. Otherwise, when the patient has been having positive experience with parent figures, the therapist mirrors and enhances that experience and watches for a natural lull in the intensity of or engagement with the process. It is important not to rush or to force a change, as it is beneficial for the patient to stay with the positive experience within a scene until its attachment-promoting benefit has peaked.\n\nRecognition of that peak is based more on intuition than on objective factors. The more attuned the therapist is to the patient and the process, the more apparent it will be that a particular scene has largely fulfilled its purpose and that a change can be fruitfully introduced. Although facilitating scene changes is beneficial to the process, it is not essential in every session. When the therapist has the sense that the patient continues to be engaged and generative with the scene that first appears, he or she simply continues to mirror and enhance the positive qualities and felt experiences that the patient describes. Some patients in some sessions will create changes in or of scenes spontaneously, and again, the therapist simply supports the continuation of engagement with the process.\n\nBRING ATTENTION TO EXPERIENCE AND AMPLIFY POSITIVE STATES\n\nCentral to the IPF method\u2019s contribution to attachment repair is the patient\u2019s direct, immediate experience of benefit from being with the imagined parent figures. To support such experience, the therapist actively and persistently points the patient\u2019s attention to his or her experiences of the parent figures\u2019 attachment-promoting ways of being. In the example below, the therapist suggests that the parent figures will be comforting, and then directly brings focus to how that feels to the patient:\n\nPatient: I\u2019m crying, and they see that.\n\nTherapist: They begin by comforting you, comforting you in the ways you need right now. You can feel the effect of them comforting you. How does that feel?\n\nPatient: They\u2019re reassuring me that it\u2019s not stupid; they don\u2019t laugh at me.\n\nTherapist: Whatever you experience matters to them. Everything about your state matters. They encourage you to talk about it. Notice the effect that has on your inner state.\n\nPatient: It\u2019s more relaxed.\n\nTherapist: It\u2019s more relaxed, yes. Feel what that\u2019s like in the body; really feeling more relaxed.\n\nIn this brief interaction, the therapist made sure that the patient\u2019s awareness of her inner state would be\n\n190 overdetermined. He stated the comforting as a fact (\u201cYou can feel the effect of them comforting you\u201d) and then asked her to report from her awareness (\u201cHow does that feel?\u201d). He affirmed that her experience mattered\u2014to the parent figures and, by implication, to him (\u201cWhatever you experience matters to them. Everything about your state matters. They encourage you to talk about it\u201d). He pointed her attention to her experience (\u201cNotice the effect that has on your inner state\u201d and \u201cFeel what that\u2019s like in the body\u201d), he mirrored her report (\u201cIt\u2019s more relaxed, yes\u201d), and he encouraged amplification of the felt experience she reported (\u201creally feeling more relaxed\u201d).\n\nThe more the patient is aware of positive inner states in relation to the parent figures and the stronger those positive states are, the more likely and efficient will be the introjection of the experiences with the parent figures to create new, positive attachment representations. Thus, the therapist both points the patient\u2019s attention to positive experience and uses phrases and phrase tone that will amplify that experience.\n\nThe value of amplifying the patient\u2019s experience is consistent with Gergely\u2019s research on \u201cmarked expressivity\u201d (Gergely & Watson, 1996) and Fonagy, Gergely, Jurist, and Target\u2019s (2002) concept of \u201cmarked affectivity.\u201d When a child\u2019s or a patient\u2019s affective experience is mirrored with exaggerated content and tone, the experience is \u201cmarked\u201d as having happened, as important, and as belonging to the self. For example:\n\nPatient: I felt happy when that happened.\n\nTherapist: You must have really felt happy when that happened. (Italicized words received tonal emphasis.)\n\nThis marking is especially beneficial when working with patients with anxious-preoccupied attachment, as they tend to focus on others\u2019 experience more than on their own. But such amplification of felt experience is valuable during IPF sessions with all patients. Developmentally, affective marking enhances awareness of and differentiation of affects (Gergely & Watson, 1996) and, as noted above, facilitates the introjection of positive attachment representations.\n\nPhrasings for bringing attention to felt experience. The therapist can be creative with phrasings, guided by the simple goal of pointing the patient\u2019s attention to positive states he or she has in response to experiencing attachment-promoting qualities in the ideal parent figures. Some possibilities include:\n\n\u2022 How does that feel? (\u201cthat\u201d refers to how the parent figures are being)\n\n\u2022 Notice what happens inside you as they . . .\n\n\u2022 You can feel the effect of . . .\n\n\u2022 Notice the effect that has on your inner state (or state of mind, or feelings).\n\n\u2022 Feel what that\u2019s like.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s [more relaxed], yes. (patient\u2019s term in brackets)\n\n\u2022 You feel that, don\u2019t you? (in response to a nonverbal indication of effect)\n\n\u2022 That feels good, doesn\u2019t it? (in response to nonverbal positive signs)\n\n\u2022 You can say what that\u2019s like inside as they . . .\n\nPhrasings for amplifying positive states. Both the content and tone of expression will contribute to amplification of positive states mirrored by the therapist. Consistent with Stern\u2019s (1985) assertion that young children have strong responses to the tone of a caregiver\u2019s voice, the therapist can tonally \u201clean into\u201d the amplification of words in phrases such as the following:\n\n\u2022 Really feel what that\u2019s like.\n\n\u2022 You can feel that [happiness] even more strongly now. (patient\u2019s term in brackets)\n\n\u2022 Yes. Really feel that now. Really feel that all through your being.\n\n\u2022 Yes. That feeling of [joy] gets even more clear now.\n\n\u2022 And soon that [sense of safety] becomes even stronger.\n\n\u2022 You might be surprised how vivid and clear that feeling of [calm] becomes.\n\nNote the tonal emphasis on the patient\u2019s own words. When the patient hears his or her own words mirrored back in marked form, the states described by those words are validated and reinforced.\n\nIn practice, as in the example at the beginning of this section, the therapist integrates the attentiondirecting and experience-enhancing phrasings. But until the patient verbalizes something about the positive states, attention-directing is emphasized. Some attention-directing phrasings can include amplification, even", "length": 3081}
{"prompt": "specific experiences of greater security in the present, the therapist suggests that the patient imagine bringing that sense of greater security to other circumstances. For example:\n\nTherapist: Now, as you\u2019re really connected to this feeling, imagine feeling it in a different situation, some situation in which you\u2019d really like to feel more secure and comfortable.\n\nPatient: Well, in classes I often want to say something, but I get too nervous and I just stay silent. Therapist: Yes, you\u2019ve been wanting to express yourself in classes. Now really tune in to the secure feeling; really tune in to that feeling, and let me know when you\u2019re feeling it really clearly.\n\nPatient: I\u2019m feeling it.\n\nTherapist: Good. Now, with this secure feeling really present, imagine being in class. And when you are imagining yourself in class, feeling secure and comfortable, let me know.\n\nPatient: Okay, I\u2019m there.\n\nTherapist: Wonderful. Now, just feel yourself there in class, feeling secure and comfortable, coming to feel it even more clearly. And when you\u2019re ready, imagine yourself feeling ready to raise your hand to say something.\n\nThis process continues as the patient imagines each step toward the desired action in the context of an inner, felt experience of a secure base.\n\nWorking in this way with the patient\u2019s present experience allows for a gradual reduction in the frequency of using the IPF protocol. At this stage of the treatment, there are two ways in which the IPF protocol continues to be of benefit: reinforcement of the secure-base experience and working with present-day affective states. Secure-base experience results from the development of new, positive attachment representations, and the stronger and more stable those representations are, the stronger and more stable will be the secure base. It is common for signs of insecurity to reappear in response to circumstances that challenge the secure base until the new attachment maps are deeply established. Thus, there is value to continuing to include IPF sessions in the ongoing treatment, even if less consistently than earlier in the treatment. Revisiting the IPF protocol is called for whenever the patient presents with signs of less security, such as an increase in dismissive and/or anxious-preoccupied features. In this circumstance, the IPF protocol can be done in a general way, without bringing the specific manifesting insecure features into the imagery. Alternatively, the affects associated with those specific features can be emphasized and brought deliberately into the imagery.\n\nFor example, a patient came to a session and reported having strong anxiety that his girlfriend might end their relationship. After establishing that she had not given any signs of wanting to do so, and that on the contrary she had suggested that they spend more time together, the therapist discussed with the patient that his anxiety probably indicated that his security was being threatened by the possibility of greater closeness. They agreed to work with the anxiety in the context of an IPF session. First, after setting the initial conditions for the IPF process (i.e., focusing awareness inward), the therapist asked the patient to bring to mind his girlfriend\u2019s suggestion that they spend more time together in order to evoke the anxiety and allow him to feel it strongly in the present in the session. When the anxious state increased, the therapist initiated the IPF protocol:\n\nNow, feeing this anxiety as you do now, imagine yourself going back, going back in time, back in time to when you were a young child, and feeling much the same way, quite anxious.\n\nThen, when the patient was imagining and feeling himself as a young child in that anxious state, the therapist suggested ideal parents who were attuned specifically to that state:\n\nAnd now, feeling yourself as a young child feeling quite anxious, you can imagine yourself being with parents, but not the parents you grew up with. You can imagine yourself being with a different set of parents, parents who are ideally suited to you and your nature, and to your feelings and needs right now. These parents recognize that you\u2019re feeling quite anxious, and they know just the right way to be with you so that you feel comforted and soothed. They know just the right way to be with you so that you come to feel safe and secure once again.\n\nAs this patient had previously established signs of an internalized secure base, he readily experienced imagery that provided him with soothing and came to feel comfortable, confident, and secure rather quickly. After reinforcing that state, the therapist brought the reestablished secure state back to the situation that had challenged it:\n\n200 Therapist: And now, very clearly feeling comfortable, confident, and secure, you can experience yourself coming back to your current adult self, bringing back with you this comfort and security. When you are back fully into your adult self feeling comfortable and secure, you can let me know with a slight nod of the head.\n\nPatient: (nods) Therapist: Good. Really feel how comfortable and secure you are. Really feel it all through you. Now, imagine yourself with your girlfriend, feeling comfortable, confident, and secure, and she\u2019s saying to you that she\u2019d like to spend more time together. And from your comfortable, confident, and secure state, feel what it\u2019s like now to hear that from her.\n\nThe patient reported a slight increase in anxiety but said that it was not too much. In the imagery, he spoke with his girlfriend to establish how and just how much they would increase their time together, and he established a plan that he felt comfortable, confident, and secure with; before the next session he presented that plan to his girlfriend, to which she happily agreed.\n\nAny affect state can be addressed similarly with the IPF method. When a patient speaks of feeling anxious, sad, lonely, or angry, regardless of the circumstance that evoked the feeling and regardless of whether the patient currently feels the state in the session or has felt it sometime prior to the session, the feeling state can be brought into the IPF imagery in a way that helps with its regulation. Working with affects in this way facilitates the development of patients\u2019 capacity to regulate their affects internally, on their own, beyond the immediate, present state. Similar to the example given above, the therapist begins the IPF session by guiding the patient to focus attention inward; he or she then asks the patient to focus on the uncomfortable affect state, and to feel it even more strongly by imagining being in the circumstance that contributed to its emergence. For example:\n\nNotice now how you feel the sadness now, how it is in your feelings and in your body. Really tune in to that, to exactly the ways you\u2019re feeling sad . . . Now, imagine yourself back several days ago, when you first started feeling this sadness. Imagine the circumstance you were in, and exactly what was happening when you started feeling more and more sad . . . You can put yourself right back there, and notice how the sadness gets even more clear, even more strong.\n\nWhen the patient indicated that the sadness was very strong, the therapist initiated the IPF protocol:\n\nFeeing this sadness as you do now, imagine yourself now going back, back in time, going back in time to when you were a young child, to when you were a young child, feeling much the same way, quite sad. Feel yourself going back, feeling yourself younger and younger, until you feel yourself as a young child, feeling sad.\n\nUpon establishing the imagery and affective state within the imagery, the therapist suggested ideal parents who were attuned specifically to the patient feeling sad:\n\nAnd now, feeling yourself as a young child feeling quite sad, you can imagine yourself being with parents, but not the parents you grew up with. You can imagine yourself being with a different set of parents, parents who are ideally suited to you and to your nature, and to your feelings and needs right now. These parents recognize that you\u2019re feeling quite sad, and they really get how difficult this is for you now. They really feel for you, and they know just the right way to be with you so that you feel comforted and soothed. They know just the right way to be with you that helps you with this feeling.\n\nThe therapist and patient explored and worked with the imagery such that the parent figures were accurately attuned to the patient\u2019s affect state and were with the patient in ways that alleviated that state. Using the IPF protocol in this way to facilitate affect regulation continues throughout the treatment, even after the use of it more generally has diminished because of consistent signs of an internalized secure base.\n\nCommon Challenges During the IPF Treatment Process\n\nTherapists may face any of a variety of challenges as they implement the IPF protocol. These challenges can be divided into three categories: (1) difficulties that the patient has with aspects of the protocol, (2) difficulties that the therapist has with implementing the protocol, and (3) difficulties pertaining to the patient\u2013therapist dyad in the context of the protocol. Therapists\u2019 understanding of these difficulties and of the challenges that\n\n201 they create, and their readiness to respond appropriately to them, will contribute to the effectiveness of the IPF method.\n\nDIFFICULTIES THAT PATIENTS MAY EXPERIENCE WITH THE IPF PROTOCOL\n\nThere are three general principles of responding to difficulties that patients have during the implementation of the IPF protocol. The first is to be empathic. While most patients ultimately experience the IPF method as deeply positive and beneficial, the method asks them to engage with part of their history that was deeply problematic\u2014their childhood experience with parents or caregivers who were unable to provide them what was needed for attachment security. The more painful their childhood experiences were, the more painful it will likely be initially for them to imagine themselves as a child and to imagine being with parent figures. Particularly during the first or first several IPF sessions, resistances based on such associations with a painful history are quite common. When a patient\u2019s difficulty is met with empathic, supportive responses from the therapist, with the verbal and nonverbal message that the therapist understands something of what it was like for the patient as a child, the patient is likely to feel attuned to and soothed and to feel that the therapy environment might just be a safe place for staying with the method, despite the initial discomfort.\n\nInitial discomfort is not problematic; in fact, it is beneficial, as it indicates that the patient has accessed something of the source of the attachment dysfunction. Further, the discomfort itself provides the opportunity for the patient to experience being protected, attuned to, and soothed and comforted by the parent figures. Until the parent figures are imagined, the therapist provides this kind of response to any discomfort that arises.\n\nSome patients, particularly those with dismissing attachment, will not initially experience any conscious discomfort but will have difficulty with engaging with the methods, such as difficulty imagining being a child or imagining any parent figures. In response, therapists are similarly empathic and supportive, based on understanding that the protocol asks the patient to visit problematic domains of personal history. Therapists can also draw from their experience that most patients find their way into the IPF imagery and come to experience it in very positive ways. It is rare for a patient to be unable to become engaged with and benefit from the method.\n\nThe second general principle for responding to patient difficulties during the protocol is to maintain a collaborative stance, modeling curiosity, interest, confidence, and patience during the shared task of establishing and engaging with imagined ideal parent figures. The therapist explicitly and implicitly highlights that he or she is there with the patient, able and willing to address and be with any difficulty that arises.\n\nThe third general principle is to contextualize patient difficulties within the IPF imagery frame. Several examples and ways of responding were already presented in pages 329\u2013337. Once the patient has created some IPF imagery, any difficulty can be referred to the parent figures for response. For example:\n\nPatient: I don\u2019t trust them. I think they\u2019ll get mad at me. I don\u2019t want to imagine them anymore. Therapist: These parents understand that you\u2019re having a hard time trusting them, and that you think they\u2019ll get mad at you. They are very present with you and very patient, and they don\u2019t get mad at you at all. They understand that you\u2019re feeling like pulling away. They\u2019re right here for you, even if you pull away, and they don\u2019t get mad at you at all.\n\nKeeping the experience within the imagery frame provides an opportunity for the patient\u2019s difficulty to be met in beneficial, nonrejecting, and nonpunitive ways by the parent figures, which contributes to the formation of new, positive attachment maps. This type of response also reinforces the frame itself, which contributes to its ongoing effectiveness as part of the attachment-repair process. When the therapist\u2019s contextualization of experiences within the imagery frame is done in the context of his or her empathic and supportive ways of being, many of the difficulties that patients may have with the IPF protocol are effectively met. Particular difficulties and additional beneficial therapist responses are described below.\n\nInability to experientially imagine being a very young child. As the first experiential imagery component of the IPF protocol is the patient\u2019s felt sense of being a young child, this is the first place where some difficulty might arise. It is not surprising when a patient initially cannot put himself or herself into a child-self state, because it is that state that experienced the circumstances that led to the attachment disturbance.\n\nThe therapist guides the patient toward the child state experience and asks the patient to nod \u201cwhen you are feeling yourself as a young child.\u201d If the patient nods, the protocol setup proceeds; if he or she does not, the therapist asks the patient about the experience. The patient may indicate the absence of any child-state", "length": 3171}
{"prompt": "This is part 3 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n The Camden Council Issue\n\nI shall turn now to the Camden Council Issue.\n\nIt is common ground that each plaintiff drew cheques payable to Camden Council in the sum of $30,000 and paid that sum to the Council on account of s 94, contributions. They claim that they are entitled to a credit in the accounting between them and the defendant in respect of that sum, or alternatively in the sum of $20,000, which entitlement they submit arises pursuant to the terms of the Building Contract.\n\nIt is necessary therefore to analyse the Building Contract.\n\nThe Building Contract\n\nThe Building Contract in each case is a standard form fixed price New South Wales Residential Building Contract for New Dwellings. In its schedule 1 Particulars of Contract item 13 provides for a builder's margin of 20% (DX 6 p.8). Pursuant to schedule 5 of the contract certain other documents form part of contract between the parties. Relevantly these documents include the New Home Tender (DX 6 p.11).\n\nSchedule 7 of the General Conditions makes provision for detailed provisional sums to be included, but none were included in schedule 7 in either contract.\n\nSpecial Condition 14(c) of the Special Conditions defines \u201cprovisional allowance\u201d to mean provisional sum as described in clause 20 (Exhibit DX6 p.16). In Clause 1 of the General Conditions \u201cprovisional sum item\u201d is defined as:\n\n\u201can item of work (including labour and materials) which cannot be costed exactly at the time that the contract is entered into and for which the builder has made allowance in the contract price.\u201d (DX 6 p.22)\n\nThe marginal note to this definition refers the reader to clause 20 of the General Conditions. Clause 20 which is headed \u201cPrime Lost and Provisional Sum Items\u201d is of importance to the proceedings. Clauses 20.5 and 20.6 are in the following terms:\n\n\u201c20.5 Each provisional sum item must have an allowance stated next to it. The allowance is the estimated price of providing work and does not include an amount for the for the builder\u2019s margin\n\n20.6 In relation to each prime cost item and provisional sum item, if the actual price is:\n\n(a) less than the allowance, the difference is deducted from the contracted price\n\n(b) more than the allowance, the total of the difference and the builders margin applied to that difference is added to the contract price. \u201c (my emphasis) (DX 6 p.30)\n\nIt is important to note the mandatory nature of the requirements in Clause 20.5. The clause requires that each individual provisional sum item must have a provisional allowance noted next to it. This is readily understandable as such precision, is essential in order for there to be a proper accounting for the provisional sum, as provided for in clause 20.6\n\nThe plaintiffs rely on the New Home Tender (DX 6 page 44 and following) to found its claim in respect of the Camden Council payments. Clause 34 of the New Home Tender is in the following terms:\n\n\u201c34 Provide a Provisional Allowance for the following:\n\nAnything in relation to Strata Title or Sub-division preparation.\n\nAny Levies or Section 94 contributions & or Bonds required by Local Authority.\n\nAny contributions or additional fees required by Water Board, Electricity Authority, Telecommunication Authority or any other relevant Authority.\n\nRegistration of linen plan at land titles office\n\nDouble handling of materials and work (due to inaccessibility of delivery and work vehicles to site).\n\nUnderground boring\n\nAny covenants or bonds required to allow release of linen plan prior to completion of development.\n\nAny legal fees.\n\nDevelopment Application, Building Application and associated conditions and costs.\n\nWorkers Executed Survey if required for stormwater.\n\nNo Allowance for stormwater, sewer or electrical & Telstra connections outside boundary lines.\n\nNo Allowance to upgrade existing sewer function.\n\nNo Allowance for additional sewer junction if required.\n\nNo Allowance for sewer main extension\n\nSection 73 fees or approval\n\nEnergising of the electrical meters & power connection to the electricity network\n\nNote: This is only a Provisional Allowance requested by the owner.\u201d (DX 6 p.47)\n\nAdjacent to the chapeau of clause 34 is following \u201c$20,000 provisional\u201d.\n\nIt can be seen therefore that clause 34 lists 16 items of which the s 94 contribution is but a part. Crucially there is no provisional sum value attributed to any of the 16 described items, as is required by clause 20.5 of the Building Contract. As I have earlier indicated, the requirement for specificity as to individual items of provisional allowance nature is mandatory under that clause. On the contrary, far from there being specificity as to the amount attributable to each of the 16 items referred to in paragraph 34, the provisional allowance mentioned in respect of them is grossed up figure of $20,000, which itself is described as provisional, and which is noted at the foot of clause 34 as being \u201conly a provisional allowance as requested by the owner\u201d.\n\nIn my view, it would not be unfair to say therefore that the grossed up figure of $20,000 is an estimate of the provisional sum, for a range of potential provisional sum items.\n\nThe plaintiff in each case says that as they have paid $30,000 to Camden Council on account of s 94 contributions, they are entitled either to that sum or the sum of $20,000 (being grossed up provisional allowance) credited to their benefit in the accounting between the parties.\n\nThis claim, in my view, is based on an incorrect analysis of the Building Contract.\n\nIn my opinion, the provisional sum allowance for the s 94 contributions never entered the contract between the parties. I take this view as there was never a monetary allowance attributed specifically to it, being an allowance which was the estimated price of providing the service as required by clause 20.5 of the contract.\n\nThe conclusion that the s 94 contributions never formed part of the Building Contract in my view is clear, as what I have referred to as a grossed up provisional allowance of $20,000 in clause 34 of the New Home Tender could never be dealt with under the procedures set forth in clause 20.6 of the contract. This is so as there is no specific provisional allowance sum to which the s 94 payment could be attributed, as was the mandatory requirement under clause 20.5.\n\nIn my view, the plaintiffs paid the s 94 contributions to Camden Council directly, and outside of the confines of the Building Contract. The builder played no part in this, and certainly did not apply a 20% builder's margin to it, which would have been his entitlement had the payment been made within the four corners of the Contract.\n\nAs such the plaintiffs are not entitled to a credit in the accounting between them and the defendant in respect of the Camden Council payment.\n\nThe $60,000 Cash Payment\n\nGiuseppe Carbone says that he paid to Mr Frank Grippaudo, the Chief Executive of the defendant, the sum of $60,000 in cash. Mr Grippaudo denies that such payment was ever made. The plaintiff Giuseppe Carbone alleges that the refusal of the defendant to acknowledge the receipt of the $60,000 in cash constitutes the tort of deceit. He also forms part of his unconscionable conduct claim.\n\nGiuseppe Carbone accepts that this allegation is an allegation of dishonesty (TP 246.14-25) and that as a consequence he is required to prove the allegation to the standard as discussed by the High Court in Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362, and as further explained by the court in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd (1992) 67 ALJR 170.\n\nThe strength of evidence required in cases of dishonesty have been variously described as \u201cclear\u201d or \u201ccogent\u201d.\n\nThe reasons for this approach is \u201cas merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct\u201d (Neat at [2]). As such a court should not lightly make a finding on the balance of probabilities, that parties to civil litigation have engaged in such conduct (Neat at [2]).\n\nIn his affidavit dated 3 November 2021, Giuseppe Carbone says that in July 2018 he had a conversation with Mr Grippaudo in which they discussed the defendant giving the plaintiff credit on the subject contract, for concreting works done by the plaintiffs on another job. This was agreed. He then alleges that in a completely unrelated way he then said to Grippaudo \u201cwould you like some liquid funds? I'm thinking about $60,000\u201d to which he alleges Grippaudo said \u201cyeah that will help me out\u201d. Then Carbone alleges that he said,\n\n\u201cwell let me know next week and I'll arrange the money for you so you can pick it up but I'll still need a receipt for it because I need to show the bank that I paid the deposit\u201d [33].\nHe says that a few days later Mr Grippaudo came to his house and he gave him $60,000 in cash in a Woolworths shopping bag.\n\nMr Grippaudo denies this.\n\nMr Carbone goes on to claim that he obtained a receipt from the defendant. However, the document which Mr Carbone claims was a receipt for the $60,000 in cash, was not in fact a receipt for $60,000, but rather was a receipt for the sum of $59,963.95 referable to a payment that was required to be made by Mr Carbone to the defendant in respect of framework (PX1 p.651).\n\nIn his affidavit in reply, Mr Carbone revisits the issue of the cash payment and in so doing gives a somewhat different version of the initial conversation regarding the payment. He says that the conversation in fact occurred in April 2017 and was in the following terms:\n\n\u201cFRANK: How did you keep your kids when you went through a divorce?\n\nME: It cost me a shitload of money. My lawyers and barrister cost me a lot but I forked it out. Hold onto the reigns because it's going to cost you a shitload of money if you go down that road.\n\nFrank and I continued to speak generally about divorce. We then had a conversation to the following effect.\n\nME: I want to pay portion of my job in cash.\n\nFRANK: Okay, how much are you talking?\n\nME: I can do 100k\n\nFRANK: It's too much but I'll take 60k\n\nTommy was initially present but he left before Frank changed the conversation to divorce and the cash contribution.\u201d\n\n(See affidavit of Giuseppe Carbone dated 8 November 2022 [25])\n\nMr Grippaudo also denies this conversation.\n\nMr Grippaudo says that occasionally the defendant's clients do make payment in cash, however, he says that this occurs only on limited occasions, and when this occurs, it occurs in denominations much less than $60,000. He says that in respect of such payments he tells his clients that their cash payment will be banked, and recorded in the defendant's accounting system, so as to ensure that the defendant\u2019s accounts reconcile for audit purposes. This he went on to say was essential to ensure the defendant's continuing access to Home Owner Warranty Insurance. He says that he would never do anything to imperil the defendant\u2019s statutory insurance. He said that any failure to bank and record a receipt of the $60,000 cash would imperil the defendant\u2019s statutory Home Owner Warranty Insurance.\n\nAs to the document acknowledging receipt of payment in sum of $59,963.95. Mr Grippaudo says that it was provided to Mr Carbone in good faith after Carbone assured him that he had paid this sum to the defendant\u2019s bank account, on account of framework. At this stage the defendant\u2019s bank records had yet to show the payment as a credit in their account. Mr Grippaudo said he issued the receipt because Mr Carbone said it was necessary for him to have the receipt as a matter of urgency. The urgency he explained arose from the fact that it was required to be provided to his bankers for the duplex development, in order for them to authorise a progress payment.\n\nMr Grippaudo says that the sum of $59,963.95 in fact was never received by the defendant. In short, he says he was duped by Mr Carbone into providing a receipt on the false representation that he in fact paid the money, which had yet to become recorded in the defendant's bank account statements.", "length": 3245}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n Stress and Back Pain\n From Chris\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing and Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: Doctors tend to dismiss him but a lot of his patients think he\u2019s terrific. Jeremy takes a middle ground. He thinks that perhaps 10 percent of back pain has primarily emotional roots and the rest is physical. In addition, psychological elements can aggravate physical pain significantly. But 10 percent is worth a word here. More than a word, actually. Jeremy and I do not presume to give psychiatric advice\u2014or advice about stress, which is mostly what\u2019s involved\u2014but we include this brief chapter just to alert you to the possibility that your back pain may have its roots in stress or it may be worsened by stress or other largely psychological issues. \nI confess that a couple of years ago I would have been even more skeptical than I am today about stress and, by extension, about the connection between stress and back pain. But there has been a lot of talk lately about stress being the great scourge of American life, especially corporate life, and the importance of \u201cmindfulness\u201d; there seems to be broad agreement that both are real and important. Some corporations are spending serious time trying to help their people learn mindfulness. Like others of my generation, I used to think that talk about stress (I\u2019d never heard of mindfulness) was something made up in California by out-of-work yoga teachers, and I said the hell with it. That, it turns out, was a deeply uninformed view. Stress, I have lately learned, is very real indeed. And it probably can raise hell with your back, all by itself. Jeremy\u2019s estimate that some 10 percent of back pain is caused by stress is probably pretty good. \nStress is a fundamental part of our emotional wiring, and it runs deep. I\u2019m going to use a little technical language here to make me sound smarter than I am. A lot of the emotional stress we face is handled by our \u201cautonomic nervous system.\u201d How do you like that! Two branches of the autonomic nervous system have a lot to do with running emotions and related body changes. The first is the sympathetic branch, which basically speeds things up when life gets hairy. The other one is the parasympathetic branch, which basically slows things down, especially after a fight-or-flight event has made you crazy. \nThe parasympathetic system is for everyday use, when things are more or less okay. It handles routine stress in a routine way, and does not make you sick or crazy. The sympathetic system is supposed to be triggered only when things get seriously scary (we are talking about the sudden appearance of lions, say, or robbers with guns)\u2014extreme situations in which it makes sense to go crazy. If there really is a lion looming in the deep grass, you\u2019ve got to get out of there ASAP, so all the stress you can muster makes perfect sense. Same deal on the streets of the city when a thief with a knife appears out of the shadows and asks if you would be good enough to give him your wallet. Or your wife. Again, legitimate stress. \nYour body does an amazing thing in those fight-or-flight situations. Everything is instantly rewired to give you the best shot at either fighting back or getting away. One big change is in the blood\u2014of which there is not enough to be everywhere at once. It is shifted from peacetime distribution to a wartime footing. It is drained out of your digestive system, for example, and redirected to your extremities: legs to run for your life, or arms and shoulders and hands to grapple with the beast. And it goes to the parts of your brain and nervous system that deal with emergencies. At the same time, your heart cranks up to deliver four or five times as much blood to your body. The hair on your body \u201cstands up\u201d so it is better able to sense movement in the air (wow!). Your eyes dilate and your hearing becomes more acute. The nutrient absorption system is shut down, as are many other systems that have to do with routine maintenance. (Chronic, nonstop stress, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, is a horror for a couple of reasons. First, you cannot be responding to those extreme conditions all the time: That would be like a muscle spasm\u2014it starts to hurt. Second, all those routine but deeply important processes get shortchanged, and you go to hell for lack of maintenance. So . . . chronic stress is super-bad.)\nWhen the threat passes (and if you survive), the parasympathetic system takes over and order is restored. The hair on your neck settles down, the regular allocation of blood returns, and so on. And it works like a charm for zebras and elands and such. For us, alas, not so good. As Robert M. Sapolsky tells us in Why Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers, the zebra can be running furiously for its life one minute, and calmly cropping grass the next. Zebras are blessed with forgetfulness. Not us. We are blessed\u2014and cursed\u2014with the ability to contemplate and prepare for future emergencies and to hold on to and learn from past ones. We are not designed to let go. Eventually we do let go, but it takes us longer. So we have more stress than zebras. \nWe have another flaw in the way our fight-or-flight mechanism works. It is not just the lion or the guy with the knife that sets off our system; it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Like competition in the workplace. Like fear of our boss. Like rejection or demotion for failure to achieve this or that. Which may not sound bad but it really is. Because we take that kind of stress just as seriously as we do the lion-in-the-grass type of stress. And the problem is that that kind of stress is being triggered almost constantly, in our aptly named \u201chigh stress\u201d workplaces and society. Which leads to chronic stress. \nIntermittent stress\u2014the kind that is triggered when the lion jumps out at you\u2014is useful. Chronic stress is a curse. Not a complete curse; it does enable \u201cadvanced\u201d cultures like ours to focus much harder and much, much longer than humans used to do on what we want to achieve. We run our mighty engines at near-redline levels all the time and, sure enough, we tear around like crazy . . . achieving great things. Which is nice. And we pat ourselves on the back for doing it. (And view the French, say, with contempt because they are not as nutty as we are.) We more than pat ourselves on the back; we give each other fat salaries and tremendous recognition. Being able to function at \u201credline\u201d or sympathetic nervous system levels almost all the time is richly rewarded in this country. Which is fine except for one thing: It is eating us alive. The dislocation of circulation from core to extremities, the hyper-use of the signaling system, all the profound changes that are set in motion when the lion looms short change other areas, including, interestingly enough, our lower backs. And that dislocation can cause random short circuits, muscle spasms, and weird torques to the back. And they hurt. Quite a lot. It is not the principal source of back pain, but, for those who suffer from it, it is deadly serious and is entitled to serious treatment.\nHow do you know if you are part of the minority for whom stress is a serious cause of back pain? Hard to say but basically it\u2019s just like what Jeremy says about back pain generally: Pay attention to the pain. Focus on the behaviors that seem to precede or go with back pain. And cut them out. If back pain is correlated with stressful situations, think about it. Maybe get yourself out of that mess. Or study one of the thousands of books about \u201cstress management\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of material out there on mindfulness, and it is helpful. \nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy, Anyone?\nOkay, here\u2019s my own little stress story, the one that made me seriously open to the idea of stress as a serious thing. \nI was recently in the midst of a ton of heavy, work-related stuff, and we had just flown out to Aspen for a series of work meetings and such (there would be a little skiing but not much). We were starting two new businesses and neither was easy. Hilary and I got to the friend\u2019s house where we were staying late at night. But the real thing was that I had learned earlier that day that my beloved coauthor and friend, Harry Lodge, was going to die of cancer in the next few days. The whole business was the very definition of stress\u2014a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d you could say. \nThe morning after our late-night arrival, I was unpacking when I had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d in my chest. Long story short, I told Hilary I felt weird, we called the local hospital, and soon I was on a gurney in a big ambulance being rushed to the emergency room. I was met by an absolutely terrific heart doc, a mild-mannered guy with a serious national reputation, even though he mostly practiced in a medium-size Colorado town. Lucky me. He said I was having a heart attack, and he was going to run a camera up my femoral artery (in my leg) to take some movies of my heart and put in stents to open the presumably clogged arteries . . . all the stuff I needed to, you know, stay alive. \nRats! I have always been proud as a peacock of my great heart and aerobic strength; now this! Good grief. \nBut it turns out it was not that bad. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says, after I come out of the anesthesia. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this every day, but you did not have a heart attack. A heart attack is a failure of the heart, caused by a blockage of blood vessels that feed the heart. In a surprisingly short time, the part of the heart that is not getting fed\u2014or the whole organ\u2014dies. That is a heart attack and, mercifully, you did not have that. In fact, your heart and the vessels that feed it are in amazing shape: You will never have a heart attack.\u201d Oh. I took that pretty well, but I was curious, too. If I\u2019m not having a heart attack, why are we here? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says again. \u201cI have only seen it a few times, but you have a classic case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . . . a temporary (and sometimes fatal) weakness of the heart itself, caused by stress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cExtremely lucky man. You have what is sometimes called \u2018the widow\u2019s broken heart,\u2019 common among recently bereaved spouses. Almost certainly brought on, in your case, by general stress and by concern for your gravely ill friend. [He had interviewed me briefly before the procedure.] Sometimes it is fatal, but not for you. And, if it\u2019s not fatal, it simply goes away.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t begin to get it. I press for more information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the videotape,\u201d he says. He wheels over this big gadget and, in a second, I am looking at a movie of my own beating heart. Yowee! A very rare treat. None of the many tests for heart problems goes inside and takes movies; it\u2019s too dangerous. But this was not a test, and here we are. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d he says, and points to what he says are the amazingly clear (unblocked) and peppy arteries all around my heart. And the strength of the muscles. Rare, he says, especially for an old chap like me. Then he drops the bomb. \n\u201cHere is where the stress hit you,\u201d he says, and points to the lower one-eighth of my thumping heart. \u201cYour other heart walls are vigorous and fine, pumping lots of blood. This area, they are not. Also, you have some fibrillation, irregular beats.\u201d He points. The difference is unmistakable. For a long time we both stare at my beating heart, see the weakness and the arrhythmia. \u201cThis will go away on its own in a while,\u201d he says. And repeats how very lucky I am. Huh.\nWhat\u2019s the point of the story? It\u2019s simple: Stress is real. You can see it in a movie of your heart. It can have a very real impact on your body. It literally weakens you and leaves you prone to all kinds of things. You can see stress happening on some occasions. And\u2014maybe\u2014there are things you can do about it. I received several serious lectures from doctors during my \u201cwidow\u2019s heart attack\u201d phase, all urging me to remember that I was in my eighties and to, for heaven\u2019s sake, cut back some on my routine. Which I did. It\u2019s an interesting compromise between staying as alive and fully committed as possible. I\u2019m still feeling my way. We\u2019ll see. \nWhat about you? All we can say is, watch yourself. By which we mean, keep an eye on your own situation and bear in mind the possibility that your back pain may be stress related. Then our advice is to quit your job, get a bowl of rice, and sit on the sidewalk. Or go live with your parents. Some damn thing, I don\u2019t know. Stress is hard. But it is not imaginary. Read up on it. Do something. \nActually, we have some better advice than that. There are a lot of well-trained people\u2014including our friend Sarah Stuart, who has done retreats and other work with me\u2014who have studied stress and who instruct businesspeople in particular in \u201cmindfulness,\u201d a technique that the great guru in the field, Jon Kabat Zinn, defines as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\u201d Okay. But my shallow experience with it would lead me to say it is learning to do relatively short bursts when you clear your mind of all thoughts about what\u2019s coming next (or what stupid thing", "length": 3416}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n RULE #6\n Crawl Before You Walk, Walk Before You Run\n From Jeremy\nAs you know by now, the essence of the protocol is lifelong behavioral change. That means changing the way you carry yourself and move (the neutral spine and all that). But it also means adopting and staying with our carefully designed (and progressive) exercise regimen. It is designed for back pain and it is essential for a permanent cure. And you have to do it correctly. There is an awful lot of text and a bunch of pictures about exercise in this book. But it\u2019s not because you have to do so many exercises; there really aren\u2019t that many. It\u2019s because we want you to do them right. Remember, you are far more likely to do these exercises with the compensatory patterns you have been doing for years unless you read closely and concentrate on doing them the right way. Doing them the wrong way will just make you better at doing bad things. \nOne great key to doing them right is to go slow in the learning process. Whether you\u2019re the type or not, you have to take it step-by-step. This is a healing process, and you cannot rush a healing process; it has its own rhythm and you have to follow it. Roll out these exercises slowly over time, progressing from one level to the next only when you \u201cget\u201d the level you are on and are ready to move up. \nRemember, it is these daily exercises that\u2014more than anything else\u2014are going to give most of you a significant and permanent reduction in pain and tightness. Other steps get you past the immediate pain. These steps make the change permanent. \nBe Still to Heal; Be Still to Stay Well \nOne of the main goals of changing your movement patterns is to make the \u201cbe still to heal\u201d concept (Rule #2, in Chapter 7) part of your daily life. Once you have achieved an initial fix, you don\u2019t have to be as still. But it is a great idea to learn to move with relative stillness (without moving your lumbar spine too much) all the time. \nThis is a big change for most of you, and you have to take it in steps; as I say, you have to crawl before you walk. The first step in learning to keep your lumbar spine still routinely is simply to learn to march in place, with a neutral spine. (This is the \u201ccrawl\u201d part of the process; it may seem too easy to bother with. It is not.) The goal is to learn to march in place with no lower spine movement. Then you can move on to other movements in this chapter.\nKey tip: If any of these movements hurt, take a step back to the last thing you could do without pain (marching in place, for instance). Stay with that for a few more days and then try to progress again. In theory, if you can march in place without pain, you can walk without pain and move without pain. It\u2019s just a matter of building up your core, turning on the right muscles, and learning to use those muscles to move in the right way. Whenever you have difficulty, go back to the previous step and start again. \nOkay, you\u2019ve done marching in place without moving your lower spine. Once that feels relatively simple, try doing this while walking. Things become a little murkier here because there are many factors at play. Because you are now weight-bearing, you need the support of important muscle groups like the glutes and latissimus dorsi (lats) to support your spine, in addition to the muscles we talked about in the core. If you can\u2019t do this at first without pain, follow the advice in the book for a while, and it will come once you have developed enough strength to support your spine while standing. \nWalking with Neutral Spine \nLearning to walk with a neutral spine means applying the same mechanics of your Slow March with Neutral Spine exercise to an upright, weight-bearing position. Almost everyone can improve their ability to walk without pain if they can do the slow march exercise on the ground. The distance you can walk without pain, or without significant increases in pain, will increase as you build core and gluteal strength and endurance by doing the exercises in this book. To get started on increasing your ability to walk with decreased pain, follow these directions:\nStep 1: Stand with good posture. Stand tall, shoulders back, head over your shoulders. Think of sticking your chest out and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaning forward. Tilt your pelvis back and forth (just like you did on the floor earlier), and stop where your lower back feels the most comfortable. \nStep 2: Use your core to lock your neutral spine in place. \nStep 3: Now try to walk while maintaining the position of your lower back and with the good posture you just set. It can help to put one hand on your stomach and one on your low back to feel for movement. Once you feel like you\u2019ve mastered maintaining neutral spine while walking, start to swing your arms from the shoulders, arm to opposite leg. This means if your right leg is swinging forward, your left arm should be as well. Make sure to always swing your arms from the shoulders as you walk; this helps dissipate force away from the spine. This movement takes time to master so don\u2019t get frustrated. Keep practicing. It gets easier after you have built endurance and strength in the muscles that support the spine. \nStep 4: If you sense your back is about to hurt, stop and have a seat for a few minutes and give your back a break. Then try walking a little longer. Over time, the period between these sitting breaks should increase, allowing you to walk farther without pain.\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complex movements. To make it easier (and to improve your chances of success) we are going to break those more complex movements down into pieces and then put them all together at the end. We will start with movement from the hips, a very basic move in all our lives all the time. Let\u2019s start with hip-hinging. Hip-hinging is a way to bend forward without stressing (i.e., bending) the spine. Done right, the axis of movement is in the hips, not the low back. Your low back should be in a protected neutral position with the core engaged. As you bend forward, your low back doesn\u2019t round or move. Let\u2019s look at a picture of hip-hinging and a picture of lumbar flexion (low back bending); one is good, the other is bad. This is simple stuff, but it is very hard to get over your ancient, bad habits. Hard but essential. \n\nHip-Hinge with Neutral Spine\nHere are a couple of pictures showing you the right way to hinge (on the left) and the wrong way (on the right). Notice the very slightly curved lower back in the hip-hinge picture on the left: no movement. Excellent! The pic on the right has quite a lot of spine movement; don\u2019t do that. When you first try this movement, it may feel awkward, and you may assume that you cannot reach as far forward with good posture. Not so. You\u2019ll soon realize that you can move just as far forward, using only your hips, as you did before, using your back. You don\u2019t lose anything and you avoid a ton of pain. Over time you will gain mobility. The reason is that moving with your lower back eventually causes pain and stiffness in your back. But moving from your hips will not have that result. Let\u2019s practice doing it right. \nRight Wrong\n\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Feel the two bones sticking out of the sides of your hips. These are called your greater trochanters. Picture a pole going through these two points, passing right through your pelvis. This is your imaginary axis of movement.\nStep 5: Now place one hand on your stomach and the other on your back. On your back, put your fingers on those little bones sticking out (spinous processes). You are putting your hands here to feel for any unwanted movement when you hip-hinge. \nStep 6: Without moving anything in the core (you shouldn\u2019t feel those little bones in your back moving), slowly bend forward on that imaginary axis of movement through the hip bones while sticking your buttocks out behind you a little bit. If you feel your stomach or back move, stop, reset, and try again.\n\nStep 7: Go only as far forward as you can without moving your back. For many of you, your hamstrings (back of legs) are going to be a limiting factor in your range of motion in the beginning. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t go too far. Your hamstrings will loosen up in time if you follow all of the advice in this book. \nStep 8: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your back or stomach. \nStep 9: This should not hurt your low back. If it does, reset your stance, find neutral spine, brace your core. Not hurting? Now try it again with a very small range of motion. Stay within the range of motion that doesn\u2019t hurt. Slowly increase your range of motion over time\u2014it will come. \nAdding Rotation\nNow let\u2019s get a little more complex. Let\u2019s add rotation to the bend. Hip-hinging correctly allows you to move forward and backward without pain. Now let\u2019s learn to move side to side. We are talking rotation. Again, think about moving from the hips. It\u2019s easiest to visualize proper rotation if you think about your waist. We don\u2019t want any movement at the waist. Try to picture your rib cage being locked on to your pelvis. That\u2019s what you want. Pretend that there are no joints between your ribs and pelvis, for this one. \nFull-Body Rotation\nThe chest, navel, and hips all move together. This means there is no (or very little) movement in the spine. The body rotates by moving the hips, knees, and pelvis. If the hips and pelvis stay facing forward while the rib cage moves, the movement comes from the waist, and therefore the lumbar spine. This type of movement can wear down the discs and joints in the spine over time, especially when additional load is applied (like unloading the dishwasher for instance). Just like hip-hinging, rotation done properly doesn\u2019t cause you to lose mobility and will improve athletic performance. Let\u2019s give it a try. Once again, the new movement is not that hard. But you are trying to unlearn a lifetime of moving with your spine. That is hard. \n\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Place your hands on the top of your pelvis with your fingers pointed forward. This hand position is to help you visualize movement of the pelvis as you get used to this movement. \nStep 5: Keep the knees bent and loose but the core engaged, and try to turn a little to the right by shifting the knees and hips. Your fingers, navel, hip bones, chest bone, and face should all point the same direction. It\u2019s okay if you pivot the feet a little bit. \n\nStep 6: Now try to the left.\nStep 7: Slowly increase your range of motion by bending more at the knees. \nStep 8: Then increase your range of motion even more by pivoting your feet. \nStep 9: At all times and especially at the end of the movement, your chest bone, head, navel, and hips should be in alignment. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\nKnee pain: Stay lighter on your feet\\ and pivot the ball of the inside foot (the side you are moving away from) as you rotate. \nTorso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat\nNow let\u2019s try to put those two movements\u2014the hip-hinge and the rotation\u2014together with a squat for a realistic, three-dimensional movement that allows you to accomplish everyday tasks (think unloading the dishwasher, putting up groceries) without stressing your back. You are going to rotate and bend down (hip-hinge), then come back up to the other side and extend. \nNotice that within that entire chain of movement, the person in the drawing does not really move his spine (look at the waist if you\u2019re having trouble visualizing that). The rib cage remains locked onto the pelvis the entire time. These pictures show you that you can go almost 180 degrees from side to side, stooping as low as you can and then extending as high as your hands can go, without compromising your back. Let\u2019s try it.\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in. \nStep 3: Stand with good posture. \nStep 4: Rotate torso to the right without twisting the waist as before.", "length": 3133}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER NINETEEN\n Congratulations! And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative", "length": 3251}

{"prompt": "21\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The LOINC vocabulary is mainly directed at identifying laboratory and radiology tests as well as physical exam findings. SNOMED is much more expansive and seeks to have terms for every aspect of biomedical practice. The overwhelming majority of LOINC terms are also in SNOMED. Basically, this question is asking what sort of term would be found in LOINC. If you\u2019re interested, Systolic Blood Pressure is 8480-6 in LOINC and 72313002 in SNOMED. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n22\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Choices B-D all match a branch of informatics with the task they are likely to perform. Choice A incorrectly pairs consumer health with physician data workflow. The key point is that a wearable computer has a potential to generate voluminous data, requires intelligent methods of analyzing and presenting that data, and is likely to be a consumer item. (REF: 1.1.1.3 - Domains, subspecialties of informatics)\n23\nTHE ANSWER IS A. CDS interface issues are present in both data entry and output. A CDS integrated into an EMR is far more likely to be used than a stand-alone system requiring duplicate data entry. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n24\nTHE ANSWER IS B.

Of the primary determinants of health, biological factors are the hardest to change. Genetic engineering may someday enable the deactivation of the BRCA1 gene (a gene linked to development of breast cancer), but not today. The other choices represent social factors, and although they may be difficult to change, they are not currently impossible. (REF: 1.2.1 - Determinants of health)\n26\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Process maps are a visual depiction of a process which easily shows which tasks depend on which. Tasks which do not depend on each other can potentially be run in parallel. Culling outliers from a dataset is a statistical process and probably not relevant to workflow analysis. When a new workflow is created, it may cause workers to expand their scope of practice. Similarly, workflow analysis often involves collecting paper forms, but neither of these processes enable parallelization. (REF 2.3.1. Methods of workflow analysis)\n27\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Hick\u2019s Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) states that the time required to make a decision is logarithmically related to the number of choices available. If we decrease the number of menu options, we can expect to decrease the amount of time the uses spends deciding which option to pick. Distributed cognition is a theory which states that decisions are not made solely by the individual. Instead, they are distributed across objects, individuals, artefacts, and tools in the environment. Fitt\u2019s law states that the time required to click a mouse on a screen item is related to the size of the item and the distance the mouse has to travel. Norman\u2019s theory of Action specifies seven items that must occur sequentially for an action to be performed: 1. Forming the goal; 2. Forming the intention; 3. Specifying an action; 4. Executing the action; 5. Perceiving the state of the world, 6. Interpreting the state of the world, 7. Evaluating the outcome (REF: Section 3.2.1 Models, theories, and practices of HCI)\n28\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The critical path is the longest path from start to finish.

Outcomes research is primarily concerned with outcomes that matter to patients. While the remained of the choices may be of interest to cardiologists or ecological researchers, the patient is most concerned with his mobility. LVEDV and ECG findings are disease-oriented endpoints, while ability to walk is a patient-oriented endpoint. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n30\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Store and forward is a common form of asynchronous telemedicine. Media files are stored on a local server and then forwarded to the consultant, who often reads the studies in batches. Real time communication and remote monitoring are forms of synchronous communication. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n31\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The first step is to construct the 2x2 table (or confusion matrix). Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. Note that you don\u2019t really need to know how many items are in the corpus in order to solve this problem. \u2028\u2028 \n\u00a0\nRelevant\nNot Relevant\nRetrieved\nA, I = 2\nK, M, N, O, T, W = 6\nNot retrieved\nB, C, D, E, F, G, H = 7\nJ, L, P, Q, R, S, U, V, X, Y = 10\n\u2028 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 R = 2 / (7+2) = 22.2%\n(REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n32\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Workflow reengineering involves changing the way a company works in order to be more efficient. Revising a clinical guideline is analogous to workflow reengineering. Six-sigma is a quality improvement framework that seeks to reduce failure to very low levels (about 3 per million). Reduction in clinical staff and replacing paper forms with electronic equivalents both may be a part of workflow reengineering, but not always. (REF: Section 2.3.2. Principles of workflow re-engineering)\n33\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The CCD is an HL7 standard which is a constraint on the Reference Information Model. It is designed to transfer health records between different systems. HCPCS is a code set for procedures and supplies that are not in the CPT. The Joint Commission is a quasi-governmental organization which inspects and certifies hospitals. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n34\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Defensive medicine is the practice of ordering low-yield tests in an attempt to decrease risk of future litigation. There are many other reasons why doctors order tests that they expect to contribute little to the diagnostic process, such as choices C and D, but these are not defensive medicine. The fiduciary relationship would be best honored by acting in the client\u2019s best interest, which is usually at odds with defensive medicine. (REF Section 1.2.6 - Forces shaping healthcare delivery)\n35\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Knowing what information is needed and how to find it is known as information literacy. Computer competency is the ability to perform basic computer functions. A controlled vocabulary is a set of concepts in a particular domain. Informatics management is the process of collecting data, analyzing it and distributing the findings. (REF: 1.1.2 - Key informatics concepts, models, and theories)\n36\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Image compression may decrease the network overhead of sharing pictures, but the other choices more directly affect interoperability. Shared terminologies and common data definitions are more or less the same concept. Protocols are the mechanisms by which data is moved from one place to another. (REF: 3.4.2 Data standards and sharing)\n37\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Research has shown that CPGs have the potential to reduce inappropriate practice variation, enhance translation of research into practice, and improve healthcare quality and safety. They may decrease the cost of care, but they may also increase the cost of care by recommending more interventions. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n38\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical guidelines are recommendations only and do not include hard and fast rules for treating patients. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n39\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In a Standard Gamble,\u00a0 a patient is asked to choose between a certain time in state of illness vs. therapy with a known risk of cure or death. The standard gamble is defined as one minus the risk of death at the point of indifference ( the point at which the patient cannot choose between treatment options). In a Time Trade-off, a patient is asked to choose between some time in a state of illness vs. some time in a state of perfect health. When using a visual analog scale, patients are asked to rate different health states on a scale where 0 = death\u00a0 and 100 = perfect health. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a measure of the value of health outcomes. (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n40\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Whenever possible, a clinical information system should be evaluated on the basis of clinically relevant outcomes, such as compliance with national guidelines or mortality. The other measures are important, but none are as valuable as a clinical improvement. (REF: 3.5.6 - clinical information system evaluation)\n41\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Preventive maintenance (PM) is any activity designed to prevent failure of a system. Making backups, checking log files, ensuring drive capacity are all PM tasks. Disaster recovery and replacing a broken printer are corrective actions, not preventive. Upgrading monitors is a form of enhancement, not prevention. (REF: 3.5.5 - Clinical information system maintenance)\n42\nTHE ANSWER IS D. As medical records transitioned from paper to electronic formats, it became much easier to extract information from the chart for use in research activities.\u00a0 The other choices reflect clinical benefits. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges) \n43\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a software vendor and consumer which describes the level of technical support to which the consumer is entitled. Effectively, this process shifts the risk of maintaining and supporting the software from the consumer to the vendor. A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is an agreement between a holder of protected health information and one of its business associates regarding the usage and dissemination of data. An End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) is an agreement between a software publisher and the end user, and most commonly exists to limit the user\u2019s ability to modify or resell the software and to disclaim responsibility from the publisher should the software malfunction. Open source software is distributed in an easily modifiable form, often for free. In general, open source software transfers all responsibilities from the publisher to the user, not the other way around. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n44\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Six-sigma is named because it seeks to minimize defects until they are six standard deviations from the mean. Although having zero defects would be ideal, C is a better answer because it is closer to 3.4 per million opportunities. The other choices are to high. (REF 2.3.3 Quality Improvement)\n45\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Accepting the current level of risk without attempting any other risk modification is called Risk Acceptance. Risk exploitation is an approach to positive risk where a risk manager does everything in his power to ensure that the risk occurs. Risk transference is when the risk is transferred to another entity, such as buying insurance. Finally, Risk Avoidance involves instituting systematic changes to ensure that the risk does not occur. In the case of cancer, this is not a valid response. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n46\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Integrated change control is a rigorous process to determine the need for changes in the scope of a project. It may involve a single individual or a committee or a change control board. Having a solid change process limits scope creep. Risk avoidance is a response to risk which seeks to avoid the risk entirely. The opposite of risk avoidance is risk exploitation, which seeks to ensure that the risk occurs. A run chart shows the output of a process over time. A sensitivity analysis relies on a mathematical model of a process. By changing input variables, one can predict how the process will turn out.\u00a0 (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n47\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Adverse clinical events are the worst-case scenario for a poorly designed system. In general, the other choices are good outcomes. (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n48\nTHE ANSWER IS D. In an ontology the relationships between terms define those terms, and are therefore explicitly stated. Synonyms (aliases) are a type of relation and must be explicitly stated. Ontological relations are quite varied and are not limited to parent-child relationships. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n49\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Recall is the percentage of relevant documents which are retrieved. In this case, \u2028\u2028 R = 2 / (1+2) = 66% (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n50\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The discount rate indicates the interest rate used in discounted cash flow analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. After one year, the $100 would increase by 10% to $110. After two years, it would increase by another 10%, to $121. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting)", "length": 3682}
{"prompt": "51\nTHE ANSWER IS C. A research looking at secular (i.e. long term, non-cyclical) data trends does not need any access to live data. In fact, giving him access to live data causes two problems. Firstly, it will slow down the system for current patients and providers. Second, if he inadvertently modifies live data, it could impugn the integrity of the whole system. (REF: 3.5.1 - Institutional Governance)\n52\nTHE ANSWER IS C. The question stem is describing black box testing where the tester has no knowledge of the inner workings of the software. As a consequence, testers generally do not have to have technical knowledge of the development platform. Static testing refers to looking at structural elements of the code itself, and therefore requires source code access. Unit tests typically involve testing small code fragments at the module or class level. While unit tests can be black box, they tend not to be, which makes C a better answer.\u00a0 (Ref 3.5.4 - Clinical information system testing)\n53\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Metadata is data about the data, and may include information about when the document was created or by whom. This information may be useful to support more complex queries. Corpus is the collection of documents being searched. An index allows for quick retrieval of information and relevancy is the property of whether or not the document meets the information need. (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n54\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The critical path of a project is the longest path from start to completion, which defines the minimum time required to complete the project. In this diagram, the critical path includes B and E. Tasks A, C and E can each be postponed without affecting the end of the project. (REF: Section 4.4.4 Project Management Tools)\n55\nTHE ANSWER IS A. By limiting choices to one of four options, the implementer is using a controlled vocabulary. Both a taxonomy and an ontology have a hierarchical relationship among concepts, while a classification generally does not. Semantic encoding exists when the codes have meaning in relation to the concept being encoded. In this case, the numbers actually do have some correlation to the concepts. As the numbers get higher, the patient\u2019s limitations get more severe. However, this reflects ordinality rather than semantics, which makes choice A a better answer. (REF: 3.4.5. Nomenclatures, vocabularies, and terminologies)\n56\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Early adopters and other volunteers are often selected from a user base to be \u201csuper users\u201d. They are given additional training and are enlisted to help train other users. In general, they are not given other technical responsibilities such as setting up interfaces, maintaining passwords or assisting with security review. In this context a superuser is not the same as the system administrator in a UNIX system who has superuser privileges. (REF: Section 3.5.3 - Clinical information system implementation)\n57\nTHE ANSWER IS C. \n(Test taker\u2019s note: There is a lot of calculation required for this question, and I doubt you\u2019d see anything this complicated on the boards. If done correctly without a calculator, this will probably take you 3-4 minutes. Most likely, you will be given some of the information instead of having to calculate it all.)\nWe are being asked to find the positive predictive value (PPV). First, we must construct our confusion matrix. Let\u2019s start with the 0.1 of the population with the disease. Since our sensitivity is 0.9, we know that the true positives should be 0.9 x 0.1, or 0.09. That leaves the false negatives as 0.001. Now, we calculate for the people without the disease. They make up 0.9 of the population and since the specificity is also 0.9, the number of true negatives is 0.81, leaving 0.09 false negatives.\n\u00a0\nTest (+)\nTest (-)\nDisease (+)\n0.09\n0.001\nDisease (-)\n0.09\n0.81\n\u00a0\nPlugging into our equation, \nPPV = \u00a0= 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.09) = 0.5\n\u00a0\nThis could also be solved using Bayes\u2019 Theorem, where D is the likelihood of having the disease and T is the likelihood of a positive test. P(T|D) is the probability of having a positive test given the disease, or sensitivity. P(D) is the prevalence of disease. P(T) is the probability of having a positive test, including both true and false positives.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0(REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n58\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The Leapfrog Group, founded by Fortune 500 companies with AHRQ support, was created in November 2000 in response to the 1999 Institute of Medicine report \u201cTo Err is Human\u201d.

The DSM is a standard vocabulary for classifying mental disorders. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n61\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Negotiation only requires that the two parties involved come to an agreement. In mediation, a third party mediator helps both sides find a solution, but they must agree to it. In arbitration, a third party judge settles the argument. In litigation, the legal system decides the outcome. (REF: Section 4.1.3 - Negotiation)\n62\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Promoting or recruiting internal candidates is generally less expensive than external candidates. It can be used to recognize contributions of current staff and may improve morale. External candidates bring diversity and fresh insights into the organization. (REF: 4.2.1 - Human Resources)\n63\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Several concepts are important in maintaining a safe CDS. Usability testing will identify problems with user interface as well as CDS alerts that are inappropriate or difficult to use. The basis upon which the decisions are made (the medical knowledge repository) must be kept up-to-date with new findings and new recommendations. When errors do arise, a complete audit trail is beneficial for tracing errors and for debugging. Downtime procedures are not relevant to the CDS per se, but are important to have nonetheless, as people who are acclimated to a CDS tend to trust the system to catch their errors for them. (REF: Section 2.1.6 - Quality and Safety Issues)\n64\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Pre-coordinated items in a vocabulary are those that are included explicitly. Post-coordinated items are those that are composed by the combination of pre-coordinated items. Codes, definitions and relationships are an intrinsic part of any vocabulary. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n65\nTHE ANSWER IS D. There is syntactic ambiguity if the sentence is constructed such that it could have more than one meaning. This is a challenging question because it requires that you understand that lexical ambiguity may result if there is a single word with more than one meaning. An example of lexical ambiguity is that the word bank can refer to a slope side of a river or a business establishment which lends money. An example of semantic ambiguity is: Olivia ate a salad with artichokes from New Zealand. Does this mean that the salad is from New Zealand? Are the artichokes from New Zealand? Both? (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n66\nTHE ANSWER IS B. A journal\u2019s impact factor is determined by comparing the number of articles it prints with the number times those articles are cited by other journals. While the other choices tend to be characteristic of high impact factor journals, B is the best choice. (REF: 1.1.3 - Clinical Informatics Literature)\n67\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Intrinsic motivations arise from within a person and tend to relate to personal feelings of success. Extrinsic motivators involve the outside world and are usually social, monetary or regulatory (REF 4.1.6 - Motivation)\n68\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Of those listed, only a modern facility is a tangible resource. The remainder are intangible. REF: (4.5.2 \u2013 Environmental Scanning)\n69\nTHE ANSWER IS C. The Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows. The Accounting rate of return is the total profits divided by investment. The average cost for a company to borrow money is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting)\n70\nTHE ANSWER IS D. EHRs and order sets are only tools to assist a clinician in caring for patients. The ordering physician will be held liable for any bad outcome resulting from an order set, even if it is misconfigured. It is reasonable to assume that the software author, the hospital and the creator of the order set will bear some liability, but not as much as the ordering doctor. (REF: 2.1.5 - Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues)\n71\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) is a standards development organization accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for communications with outpatient pharmacies. Inpatient pharmacy orders are typically covered by Health Level Seven (HL7) messages. The X12 committee creates standards for electronic data interchange, and the X12N subcommittee is responsible for communications with insurers. (REF: Section 3.4.3 Transaction Standards)\n72\nTHE ANSWER IS B. These are descriptions of innovativeness or eagerness to adopt new technology. (REF: Section 4.6.2 - Change Theories)\n73\nTHE ANSWER IS B. When the insurer requests information and it is returned by patient accounts, that represents a two-way conversation. The other choices are interactive, but none is truly bidirectional. For example, although the clinician need not agree with the clinical decision support system, he has no way of communicating with it. Similarly, although all research is informed by the medical literature, and researchers commonly write letters to the editors of their favorite journals, choice B is a better example of bidirectional communication. (REF: 1.2.3 - The flow of information)\n74\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups (MSDRG) stratify patients by the severity of their disease and the expected length of time that they will remain under inpatient care. Each MSDRG is assigned a weight which determines hospital reimbursement as negotiated with individual payors. CPT is used to encode professional (i.e. physician) procedures. ICD-9 was used to record diagnoses until it was supplanted by ICD-10. The NDC is used to identify medication packages.\u00a0 (REF: 3.4.5. Nomenclatures, vocabularies, and terminologies)\n75\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Interfacing is the process of setting up communication channels between information systems. In contrast, integration is when two or more systems use the same data store. In the case of two hospitals which would like to retain their respective EHRs, integration would be very difficult, if not impossible. Neither Certification nor anonymization would help this process. (REF: Section 3.1.6. Technical approaches that enable sharing data)\n76\nTHE ANSWER IS A. A mesh network connects each node to every other node. A simple point-to-point network connects two nodes to each other. (You might argue that in a 2-node network, all nodes are connected to every other node, but the question specified that there were multiple nodes). A star network contains a central hub to which all nodes connect. A star of star networks is often called a snowflake. (REF 3.1.3 - Networks)\n77\nTHE ANSWER IS D. TURF is a unified framework for EHR usability. Distributed Cognition is a theory that states that decisionmaking is not solely an individual activity, but distributed across objects, individuals, artefacts, and tools in the environment. GOMS is a cognitive model of human-computer interaction that seeks to measure complexity of tasks. A Learning Health System is an EHR which continuously incorporates new information to build a more robust and adaptive system. (REF: Section 3.2.3 - Interface design standards and design principles)\n78\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Tactical goals of project management involve making sure that a project runs within budget and schedule and otherwise meets the needs of the sponsors.

{"prompt": "101\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Just over half of clinical research in the US is sponsored by industry, such as drug and medical device manufacturers. The remained is funded by public sources, such as the NIH. Academia typically receives funding for research but funds only a small amount itself. Charity, in the form of private grants, makes the smallest contribution. (REF: 1.2.2.3 - Clinical Research)\n102\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Telemedicine providers are required to maintain licenses in each state or province in which patients may be found, regardless of what location they are in when the service is provided. The IMLC attempted to enact a rule that would ease this restriction. Unfortunately the act never passed. (REF: 3.3.4 - Telemedicine)\n103\nTHE ANSWER IS B. DICOM files are binary encoded and are not easily readable without a dedicated parsing program. The CCD is a constraint on the Reference Information Model (RIM) and is a type of HL7 V3 document. These are encoded in extensible markup language (XML), which is generally human readable. In addition, the CCD is constrained to specifically have a human-readable text component. By specification, FHIR also should have a human readable component. (REF: Chapter 3.4.4 - Messaging Standards)\n104\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Despite the fancy language, a corrective action is something that fixes a known problem. This is distinguished from a preventive action, which is something that ensures the future performance of the project work is aligned with the project management plan. Integrated change control is a process where the scope of the work is changed from what was originally planned. Project acquisition involves the implementation and close-out of a project. (REF: Section 4.4.5 Project Management \u2013 Informatics project challenges)\n105\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Physician licensure is under the control of state medical boards. Board exams are administered by one or more of the member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Permission to begin clinical trials on a new drug is the purview of the Federal Drug Administration. Hospital accreditation is usually performed by private companies, such as the Joint Commission, but can also be done by state agencies. However, since it is normally done by private agencies, choice C is a better answer.\u00a0 (REF: 1.1.6 - Legal and Regulatory Issues)\n106\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Clinical decision support should be way to reduce physicians\u2019 cognitive burden. Although it is often characterized as pop-up alerts which interrupt workflow, this is not the intention. Infobuttons are links embedded in an EHR which refer to external websites. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n107\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Selecting a testing methodology will never be a one-size-fits-all proposition. It will depend on the organization\u2019s goals and constraints as well as user accessibility, and experience of the design team. Role-playing and cognitive walkthroughs may be used, but not always. Security concerns may be important, but are only part of the decision for picking a methodology. In general, testers should not be developers of the intended system, as they are likely to bring biases and training to the testing suite.\u00a0 (REF: Section 3.2.2 - HCI Evaluation)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n108\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Normalized databases are designed to have as little redundancy as possible so that each database row refers to a single concept (atom). Compared to denormalized databases, they tend to take up less space on disk and allow for easier writes (assuming the write only involves a single table). They may contain indexes, but this is not a defining feature of denormalization.\u00a0 They are less prone to data anomalies because they have less redundant information. Denormalization is often used to optimize read performance, and normalized tables tend to be slower because the database has to spend time matching keys from different tables.\u00a0 (REF 3.1.1 - Computer Systems)\n109\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Gerteis listed six dimensions of patient-centered care: Respect for values; coordination of care; education and communication; comfort; emotional support; involvement of friends and family. Effectiveness refers to selecting treatments based on best available evidence. Efficiency is getting the most reward for the healthcare dollar. Safety means reducing errors. (REF 1.2.7 Institute of Medicine Quality Components)\n110\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Patients with unusual or conflicting diagnoses pose a challenge to human physicians and even more to computers. Errors may occur when users have \u201calert fatigue\u201d or when the OE system is far away from the bedside, but that would not cause the CDS to give wrong information. When the CDS requires structured data input, users may attempt to put misleading information into the CDS, but does not directly affect the recommendations that come out of the CDS. (REF: Section 2.1.6 - Quality and Safety Issues)\n111\nTHE ANSWER IS A. A case series is a published report of similar patient presentations, usually less than 10. When it is only a single patient, it is a case report. An editorial is a published opinion by a member of a journal\u2019s editorial staff. It rarely presents new information. A method paper (also called an application paper) describes a novel technique or procedure. Original research involves asking a study question and using statistical methods to analyze results. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n112\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Before teams can work together, the goals of the team have to be known. After that, the rules of operation are described and individual roles are clarified. (REF 4.2.2 - Team productivity)\n113\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Waterfall is one of the oldest methods of software development, and it is modeled after manufacturing design. Its five steps include requirement (defining the project requirements), design(creating the software architecture) implementation (writing the code), verification (debugging), and maintenance. The first two steps in waterfall consume nearly 50% of resources. The rationale of waterfall is that a few hours of careful planning can save days or weeks down the line. One of the most important tenets of waterfall is that steps only go forward, and one can not progress to the next step until the previous step is finished. Changing project requirements in the middle of a project is avoided at all costs. It is sometimes called a top-down process because it starts with planning and ends with implementation. In the rapid prototyping approach, the developer creates a user interface and later implements the business logic. This is sometimes called a \u201cbottom-up\u201d process. (REF 3.1.1 - Computer Systems)\n114\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Concept orientation means that concepts have one meaning (\u201cnonvagueness\u201d) and no more than one meaning (\u201cnonambiguity\u201d). Similarly, a given meaning may correspond to no more than one concept (\u201cnonredundancy\u201d). Versioning refers to maintaining explicit versions of an ontology so that changes to the ontology do not create discrepancies between communicators.

They may, however advise government officials on how to control illness. They are commonly involved in syndromic surveillance as well as public education programs. (REF: 1.2.2.2 - Public Health)\n116\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The earned value is the estimate of what the current work is worth. The amount of money spent on the project is the actual cost. The amount of value that is expected to be done at this point in time is called the planned value. If the earned value is greater than the actual cost, the project is under budget and has a positive cost variance. If the earned value is greater than the planned value it is called positive schedule variance, and the project is ahead of schedule. Choice B is expresses this situation. (REF: Section 4.4.3 Project Management Resource Allocation)\n117\nTHE ANSWER IS A. A champion is a respected member of a group in which a change is desired. In the informatics context, this term is mostly used in conjunction with a physician champion, a member of the medical staff who is passionate about embracing technological or operational changes. Developers and designers create products. Officers are leaders and decisionmakers in an organization. They are often entrusted to bind the organization\u2019s resources to specific projects. (REF 1.1.1.4 - Careers in informatics)\n118\nTHE ANSWER IS A. In a mesh network, each node is connected to every other node. If a single node or link fails, all the remaining nodes and links remain active. In a point-to-point network, if a single link or node goes down, the network is effectively divided in half. In a star network, if the central hub fails, there is no further communication. A Snowflake is a star of star networks and has the same susceptibility. (REF 3.1.3 - Networks)\n119\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Meta-analyses often use odds ratio (OR) for discrete variables and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables. An odds ratio of >1 generally indicates a treatment benefit. If the confidence interval (CI) does not cross the OR=1 line, the results are statistically significant. (REF: 2.2.3 - Clinical Guidelines)\n\u00a0\n120\nTHE ANSWER IS A. There are at least four problems which persist in even the best of medical record systems: (1) the need for standards in medical terminology; (2) concern about privacy, confidentiality and security; (3) many physicians remain resistant to using an EHR, and most will claim that they can document and order tests much more quickly on paper; and (4) interoperability between disparate systems is still quite difficult. Audit trails, however, are much more reliable. (REF 1.1.1.6 - Current and Future Informatics Challenges)\n121\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Environmental scanning, or SWOT analysis seeks to identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. The internal scan includes the strengths and weaknesses while the external scan includes the opportunities and threats. A company\u2019s resources may be tangible, such as financial, physical or technological resources. They may also be intangible, such as human resources or reputations. Highly skilled workers would be an intangible resource and therefore be considered one of the company\u2019s strengths. The external scan (sometimes called PESTEL analysis) identifies political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors which may impact the organization. (REF: 4.5.2 \u2013 Environmental Scanning)\n122\nTHE ANSWER IS A. The five rights of CDS refers to a framework when planning or implementing CDS interventions, which are (1) The right information; (2) To the right person; (3) In the right format; (4) Through the right channel; (5) At the right time. The other options are irrelevant. Incidentally, it would be difficult to construct a star with 5 right angles. (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n123\nTHE ANSWER IS C. This question is tricky because it expects you to know the rate at which things are adopted -- not how many are in each category. The S-shaped curve is sometimes called a sigmoid curve. (REF: Section 4.6.2 - Change Theories)\n124\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A systematic review involves employing a rigorous search strategy to identify sources of information relevant to a clinical question. When data from those studies are pooled into a single data table, the result is a meta-analysis. A randomized, controlled trial is type of original research where participants are randomized into a study arm and a control arm and analyzed for differences. A chart review generally involves reviewing patient records for research or quality improvement. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n125\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The organizational chart shows staff members who report to project managers who report directly to the chief executive. This is a project organizational chart. The most common type of organizational chart is the functional organizational chart where workers are arranged by function instead of their role in a particular project. A matrix organizational chart is a hybrid between project and functional because each worker reports to two people, a functional leader as well as a project manager. A geographical organizational chart groups workers by the region they serve. (REF: Section 4.4.1 Project Management Basics)\n126\nTHE ANSWER IS D. McClelland\u2019s acquired needs theory states that an individual\u2019s specific needs are acquired over time and shaped by personal life experiences. Herzberg\u2019s Motivation-Hygiene theory describes two hygiene factors (required for sustenance) and motivation factors (useful for inspiration). Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs categorizes needs from physical survival, safety, security, followed by psychological needs and then self-fulfillment. Lewin\u2019s Field Theory states that an individual\u2019s behavior is a function of one\u2019s own characteristics as well as the group. (REF 4.1.6 - Motivation)\n127\nTHE ANSWER IS D. RxNorm is a normalized database of prescribable medications and can be used as a crosswalk between different databases. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n128\nTHE ANSWER IS B. The purpose of regression testing is to make sure that upgrades in the software do not break any other modules or components of the program. Installation testing ensures that the program runs in the expected environment. Unit testing involves supplying test data to small sections of code to make sure that they provide correct results. White-box testing refers to testing software when the source code is known. It is distinguished from Black-box testing where the software internals are unknown to the tester.\u00a0 (Ref 3.5.4 - Clinical information system testing)\n129\nTHE ANSWER IS A.

The IPPS pays hospitals based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG). Physicians are not paid via the IPPS. The DRG is determined primarily by the diagnosis itself, not based on the number of services that are actually provided or days the patient spends in the hospital. (REF: Section 1.2.5 -\u00a0 Health economics and financing)\n193\nTHE ANSWER IS D. According to McClelland\u2019s theory, there are three classes of needs: need for achievement - a strong need to excel by setting and accomplishing challenging goals; need for affiliation - an individual\u2019s need to belong to a group, be liked by the group, and be accepted by others; need for power - the need to be strongly influential, lead, and make a lasting impact on others. (REF 4.1.6 - Motivation)\n194\nTHE ANSWER IS A. This is a description of a case-control study. The investigator has tried to match cases with controls to provide more meaningful statistical comparison. A cross-sectional study is a \u201cmoment in time\u201d study of a population. A prospective cohort study is similar to a case-control study, but differs in two significant ways. A case-control study is retrospective while a cohort study could be prospective or retrospective. A cohort study identifies people with a risk and seeks to find if they have an outcome. A case-control study identifies patients with a disease and seeks to find risks. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n195\nTHE ANSWER IS A. The Reference Information Model (RIM) is a structure which allows transmission of information along with references to data dictionaries that define that information. Since different types of communications have different requirements, various constraints have been defined. One of the best known constraints on the RIM is the Continuity of Care Document which is a requirement for Meaningful Use. The other choices are very wrong. Hopefully, you didn\u2019t pick them. XML is a markup language which is used to express classes of the RIM. SNOMED is a controlled vocabulary which is a heavily referenced data dictionary in the RIM. HL7 V2 is the predecessor to V3, and predates the RIM. By the way, I\u2019m kidding about the other choices. I put them in to trick you. It\u2019s OK if you picked them. (REF: 3.4.7 Interoperability Standards)\n196\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Choice D represents a patient-oriented outcome, and would be given SORT class A or B depending on the quality of the study. Choice C gives a disease-oriented outcome and is class C. Choices A and B are also class C. NOTE that you really don\u2019t have to know the SORT criteria to answer this question, as long as you know that clinical evidence is better than consensus and that patient-oriented outcomes are better than disease oriented outcomes. (REF: Section 2.2.2 Evidence Grading)\n197\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The hallmark of the situational leadership model is that the degree of supervision roughly correlates to the degree of maturity (performance readiness) of the subordinate. Choice A is specifically wrong because it encourages delegation in most groups instead of just the most mature. Choice B is is an example of the trait theory, or the Great Man theory. Situational Awareness is not part of the Situational Leadership Model, and was just thrown in as a foil. It refers to the ability to remain aware of one\u2019s surroundings while working on a task.\u00a0 (REF: 4.1.1 Dimensions of Effective Leadership)\n198\nTHE ANSWER IS C. In a fee for service model, physicians are paid for the services they provide. More services translates into more revenue. Capitation, the model used by accountable care organizations,\u00a0 involves paying a fixed price for each patient insured, so increasing services does not result in more revenue. The IPPS is similar to capitation in that it assigns a particular value to each hospital admission, grouped by diagnosis, not by length of stay or services provided. Notably, IPPS pays hospitals, not doctors.\u00a0 (REF: Section 1.2.5 -\u00a0 Health economics and financing)\n199\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Representation Bias is the tendency to overestimate unusual diseases or conditions due to matching pieces of the typical picture of that disease. Anchoring Bias is the tendency to rely too heavily, or \"anchor\", on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject). This usually leads to a failure to adjust the probability of a disease based on new information. Value based bias\nis the tendency to over or under estimate the probability of an outcome based on the perceived value associated with that outcome. Belief bias is the tendency to judge the strength of arguments based on the plausibility of their conclusion rather than how strongly the evidence supports that conclusion. (REF Section 2.1.1 - The nature and cognitive aspects of decision making)\n200\nTHE ANSWER IS B. In the Delphi method, a group leader sends open-ended questions to all participants. Their responses are collected anonymously and then collated and sent back to the group for refinement. After several cycles, an answer is found. The participants never actually meet face-to-face. Consensus Mapping is a complicated procedure where group members meet in small and larger groups in order to determine consensus. In Nominal Groups, each member writes their idea on a slip of paper, which is then discussed in a round-robin format. Groupthink is the tendency for members of a group to surrender their individual ideas to the group. (REF 4.2.3 Group Management Processes)\n201\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Choice C represents the win-win situation where the parties desire a mutually beneficial solution. This is called Problem Solving by Pruitt, Integrating by Rahim and Collaborating by Thomas. The other choices represent lesser options. If Compromising had been a choice, that would also have been correct. (REF: 4.1.4 Conflict Management)\n202\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Technological developments in the United States continue to facilitate the use of CDS. There has been an increased purchase and use of EHR systems primarily as a result of governmental funding and policy initiatives. Stabilization in technology has also added to CDS adoption, but finances are a better option. Physicians and patients are rarely part of the decisionmaking process in terms of implementing CDS.\u00a0 (REF: 2.1.3 - Application of CDS)\n203\nTHE ANSWER IS C. External validity refers to the ability to extrapolate findings from the study population to the general population. If the populations differ in significant ways, the results may not translate well. Choice A describes a lack of precision introduced by an inaccurate measurement device. Choice B describes a systematic bias because the machine always reports high, which is consistent with a lack of internal validity. Choice D is irrelevant. Observational studies do not have blinding. (REF: Section 2.2.2 Evidence Grading)\n204\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Choice A reflects indirectness. There is no study comparing A to B directly, only to a placebo intermediate. Choice B describes a dose-response curve which strengthens the evidence. Choice C describes an opportunity for attrition bias (or transfer bias). However, the evidence shows effect in the opposite direction, making it more credible. Choice D is an example of an all-or-none effect which also strengthens the evidence. Again, to answer this question, you don\u2019t need to know the GRADE criteria, only that overcoming bias, finding a dose-response curve or an all-or-none finding strengthens a claim while indirectness weakens it. (REF: Section 2.2.2 Evidence Grading)\n205\nTHE ANSWER IS C. In 2009, the American Medical Informatics Association published two key papers that introduced a clinical subspecialty for informatics physicians. During the coming years, AMIA leadership petitioned the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and the American Board of Preventive Medicine (ABPM) and American Board of Pathology (ABP) to establish a board exam as well as accreditation standards for fellowships in clinical informatics.

The remainder of the calculations are incorrect. This question is one example of where it really makes a difference if you read all the choices before beginning calculations! (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n208\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Indexes allow rapid searching for keywords and can speed queries by several orders of magnitude compared to linear search. Recall and Fallout are measures that reflect the accuracy of the query, but not its speed. Tokenization is the process of breaking documents into searchable items. Tokenization must be done before items are placed into an index. (REF: Section 2.2.5 - Information Retrieval)\n209\nTHE ANSWER IS A.\u00a0 The Negative Predictive Value of a test is defined as the number of true negatives divided by the total number of negative tests i.e. NPV=TN/(TN + FN). For any given specificity of a test, the larger the percentage of tested patients who\u00a0 have the disease, the more likely there will be false negatives, thus making the NPV lower.\u00a0 (REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n210\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Remote monitoring of ICU patients is a common application of telemedicine technology. PACS requires higher bandwidth than can be provided by telephone (voice only) service. Poison control centers normally use voice-only communications. Telepresence refers to simulating the remote environment locally. Video conferencing is rarely needed for scheduling. \n211\nTHE ANSWER IS A. According to the report, expanding information technology is one way to cross the quality chasm. It should be no surprise that that is one of the reasons why this report is required reading for the clinical informatics boards. The other options are all mentioned in the report, but are not as prominent or over-arching as expanding technology. (REF 1.2.7 Institute of Medicine Quality Components)\n212\nTHE ANSWER IS A. By appealing to an outside authority, the negotiator effectively stops the negotiation by saying that he is unable to commit to a resolution at that time. The other choices often result in a quicker negotiation. (REF: Section 4.1.3 - Negotiation)\n213\nTHE ANSWER IS C. The p-value indicates the likelihood that the results could be entirely due to chance. It does not take bias or measurement inaccuracy into account. (REF: Section 2.2.1 - Evidence Sources)\n214\nTHE ANSWER IS D. The reason why systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so powerful is that they can reduce the risk of bias introduced by individual studies. While the remaining answers are essentially true, they do not address the issue of bias which is the most important in grading of evidence. Choice A points out the greatest weakness of basic science research. Since it doesn\u2019t take into account human behavior, it can\u2019t reliably predict outcomes. Choice B fails to account for the fact that an individual observer is much MORE likely to have bias than a group of observers. Choice C is true, but we are talking about grading of evidence, and expert opinion is not evidence. (REF: Section 2.2.2 Evidence Grading)\n215\nTHE ANSWER IS B. As computers are unable to lie, the have no choice but to be honest. Choices A and D are wrong because the majority of EHR\u2019s do not prevent misdiagnosis and very few of them are capable of the fine-grained access control described. Consider the case of a 17-year old girl who wishes to hide her pregnancy from her parents, but wants them to be able to see the rest of her medical records unimpeded. Choice C is wrong because poorer people do not have the same access to internet as richer people (e.g. the \u201cdigital divide\u201d) (REF: 1.1.5 - Ethics and Professionalism)\n216\nTHE ANSWER IS B. Responsibility is being accountable for something. Authority is the power to make decisions and issue orders. When the board of directors asks for something, they are extending responsibility; when they restrict the budget, they are taking authority. (REF: Section 4.1.2 - Governance)\n217\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Sensitivity analysis is an analysis method that is used to identify how much variations in the input values for a given variable will impact the results for a mathematical model. A run chart graphs the output of a process over time. A control chart is similar to a run chart but also includes upper and lower bounds. Monte Carlo analysis is an iterative process where the risk of a project can be calculated from the combination of its component risks.

{"prompt": "221\nTHE ANSWER IS A. Depreciation is an accounting method of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. The direct materials budget is part of the operating budget for purchasing raw materials. An MRI machine is expected to last more than one year, and would therefore be on the capital budget, and not an operating expense. A mortgage is a many-year loan used to buy large items, usually real estate. (REF 4.5.5 Capital and operating budgeting)\n222\nTHE ANSWER IS A. When the results of a study are dichotomous and dramatic, it is often termed an all-or-none study. This particular study could also be called a case series or perhaps even a method paper, but these were not among the options. Ethics violations arise when patients are subjected to substandard care. In this case, there is no available cure or treatment for macular degeneration, so as long as patients consented to treatment, there are no ethical problems.

Instituting a significant change for a small part of the population would not be as effective as initiating a modest change for the majority of the population. In this question , choice A reflects making a big change for few people, while choice D would make a modest change for many people. Choice C is actually very similar to choice A in that it would make a big difference to very few people. Choice B offers a modest benefit to a small population. (REF: 1.2.1 - Determinants of health)\n225\nTHE ANSWER IS B. A strategy is the means by which an organization sets out to achieve its goals. A resource is a tangible or intangible aspect of the organization which can be used for this task.

It was developed at the Veterans Affairs\u00a0 hospitals for use in their EHR, called VistA. The CCD is a standard developed by HL7 and is a constrain on the RIM. It became popular when it was included in the Meaningful Use criteria. (REF 3.4.1 - Standards Development)\n232\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Hospitals, like other service industries, spend most of their capital on labor costs, so minimizing those costs increases revenues. Product innovation and customer loyalty may be important goals, but are not HRM tasks. Decreasing revenues is not an objective. (REF: 4.2.1 - Human Resources)\n233\nTHE ANSWER IS B. As time goes on, bugs become easier to find, but harder to fix because of the numerous moving parts. Warranties are sometimes, but not always provided with software, and tend to have limited support options. Testing a running system is a form of dynamic testing. Static testing involves reviewing source code. By definition, implementation means a running system, which makes static testing a poor answer.\u00a0 (Ref 3.5.4 - Clinical information system testing)\n234\nTHE ANSWER IS D. A service which can be provided on a large scale is not valuable, rare, inimitable or specific to the organization. The other choices all contain an aspect which makes the product hard to replicate. (REF 4.5.3 \u2013 Strategy Formulation)\n235\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Criteria for de-identification are based on how hard it would be to re-identify a patient based on bits of data. Since dates of birth are often found in public records, it is much more susceptible to re-identification than, say, account numbers which are only found in patient records and hospital information systems. While choices B and D are true, they are not relevant to this question. (REF: Section 3.1.6. Technical approaches that enable sharing data)\n236\nTHE ANSWER IS C. Of the three requests listed, the RFQ is the most basic, and is used when the nature of the product is already known and the purchaser is simply negotiating price. An RFP is a formal document which explains, in detail, an organization\u2019s needs and typically includes a thorough response from a vendor. An RFI is a shorter, less formal document of the same nature. The SDLC is a systematic method of designing and building systems.

Heuristics allow people to solve problems and make judgments quickly and efficiently, but they are also prone to errors. Cognitive bias often results from heuristics and can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality or good judgment.\u00a0 Decision support tools are designed to optimize results by providing additional information or alerting a clinician to the need for additional information. Likewise, Bayes Theorem is designed to optimize decision making. It does this by taking into account the pretest probability of a condition, while interpreting the results of testing. (REF Section 2.1.1 - The nature and cognitive aspects of decision making)\n239\nTHE ANSWER IS D. This is a confusing question, but it illustrates some points about nonsemantic concept identifiers. First of all, semantic concept identifiers can help the reader understand a concept\u2019s place in the hierarchy. For example, ICD-10 is a hierarchical terminology. The code W21 corresponds to being hit by a ball. The code W21.01 corresponds to being struck by a football. W21.02 is a soccer ball. W21.03 is a baseball. Suppose we wanted to extend the hierarchy to include all kinds of sports injuries, including being hit by a jai-alai ball or a medicine ball. At some point, we\u2019d either run out of numbers or we\u2019d have to change the coding system. This is why choice B is a good argument. Now suppose we decide that we want to group all football injuries together, such as being tackled, which is Y93.61. Unfortunately, this code is found in a completely different hierarchy and can\u2019t be found within the W21 group, which is why C is a good reason. Similarly, choice A explains the next step in this argument. Suppose we did reclassify all football injuries into the same heading. As long a we respect concept permanence (concepts can not be deleted), we would now have an orphan code of Y93.61. Finally, we are left with choice D. At one point, when computing power was relatively expensive, using integer codes was much more efficient. With modern systems, the difference is less important. Although D is a reasonable choice, it is the weakest argument among those listed. (REF: 3.4.6 Ontologies and Taxonomies)\n240\nTHE ANSWER IS D. Using the formula for the positive predictive value, \nPPV=TP / (TP+FP)\n19/(19+1) = 95%\n(REF: Section 2.1.2 - Decision Science)\n241\nTHE ANSWER IS C. There are many approaches to managing change, but all include the formation of a group of leaders to spearhead the mission. Effective change requires buy-in from all stakeholders. If rank and file employees are unaware of the ultimate goals of the change, they are less likely support the process. Similarly, if employees are not empowered to make decisions, the entire process will slow down whenever it encounters a new variable. Short term wins should be in line with the corporate vision, but should not be used to define the vision. The vision should already be in place before short term wins are achieved.

{"prompt": "Summarize this: Establishing the BC of theory is an important challenge that permeates all domains of organizational\nresearch, such as entrepreneurship, human resource management, operations management, organi\ufffezational behavior, and strategic management. Table 1 depicts examples of BC-exploring investiga\ufffetions for each of these domains.\nConceptualization of Boundary Conditions\nWhetten (1989) describes the function of BC as conditions that \u2018\u2018place limitations on the proposi\ufffetions generated from a theoretical model. These temporal and contextual factors set the boundaries\nof generalizability, and as such constitute the range of the theory\u2019\u2019 (p. 492). Other authors also\nestablish connections between BC, the generalizability of a theory, and context (e.g., Bacharach,\n1989; Dubin, 1978; Edwards & Berry, 2010).\nIn his definition of BC, Whetten (1989) refers to a theoretical model, a term that he uses\nsynonymously with theory, as Dubin (1978) also did. Therefore, it is important to consider the\nnotion of theory first. The definition of theory has been debated throughout the history of the\nphilosophy of science. Organizational research has also been concerned with its understanding of\ntheory and the related questions of what constitutes a theoretical contribution and what makes a\ntheory a good theory (e.g., Bacharach, 1989; Corley & Gioia, 2011; Davis, 1971; DiMaggio, 1995;\nDubin, 1978; Merton, 1968; Sutton & Staw, 1995; Weick, 1989, 1995; Whetten, 1989). Our own\nperspective is best depicted by highlighting some elements of theory that are important for the\npurposes of this article. We assume that empirical reality exists objectively and is represented in\ntheoretical models in a simplified manner. In our view, the purpose of theory is to describe, explain,\nand predict a part of this empirical reality; its predictions are amenable to empirical tests. Moreover,\nwe conceive of theory as consisting of theoretical constructs (concepts, variables) and causal rela\ufffetionships (hypotheses, propositions) that describe the way in which the constructs interact.\nTheories in the social sciences are not applicable irrespective of context. Context has been labeled\nan \u2018\u2018amorphous concept capturing theory-relevant, surrounding phenomena or temporal conditions\u2019\u2019\n(Bamberger, 2008, p. 839) and defined as \u2018\u2018situational opportunities and constraints\u2019\u2019 (Johns, 2006,\np. 386).2 Practically, context is multidimensional (Bamberger, 2008) and relates to various temporal\nand spatial conditions (Bacharach, 1989).3 We can think of a dimension of context as a variable (or\nvariable range) at the same level of analysis as the unit of analysis (e.g., when small- or medium\ufffesized enterprises depict the context for firm-level research) but also as a higher-level variable in\nwhich the units of analysis are nested (e.g., when context is a country or industry in which firms\noperate). For the moment, we will concentrate on the first delineation to foster readability, followed\nlater by the second. Moreover, to ease the discussion, we assume that the \u2018\u2018context-delineating\nvariable\u2019\u2019 is continuous (without loss of generality).\nNow, let us begin developing the BC concept itself. In accordance with the understanding of\ntheory as an empirical model that represents the real world in a simplified manner, a given theory can\nfit the empirical reality to differing degrees, measured by the deviation of the theory\u2019s predictions\nfrom the real values. This accuracy does not exist in an absolute manner but depends on the empirical context. For example, while the resource-based view may accurately predict the behavior\nof firms operating in low- or moderate-velocity environments, it appears to break down when firms\nare operating within high-velocity markets (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). Similarly, while traditional\noperations management literature on the focused factory may explain the behavior of discrete-parts\nmanufacturing firms accurately, it misrepresents the context of international process industries\n(Ketokivi & Jokinen, 2006). Scholars may however be able to adjust a theory structurally (i.e., by\nmaking changes and amendments to constructs and or causal relationships) such that the fit to high\ufffevelocity markets, international process industries, or any other meaningful delineation of context\nimproves. For example, a moderating variable may be amended. Such structural changes influence\nthe simplicity of a theory, as indicated by the plurality of concepts and relationships. Structural\nchanges can foster the degree of cross-context applicability of a theory, which we refer to by the term\ngeneralizability.\nAssuming that a theory is given, such that its structure in terms of concepts and relationships\nbetween the concepts is fixed, we can conceive of the accuracy of its theoretical predictions as a\nmathematical \u2018\u2018function\u2019\u2019 that varies across contexts. We use the term function in the established\nsense of a relation between a set of inputs and exactly one output for each combination of inputs. Accordingly, the boundary conditions function of a given theory depicts the accuracy of theoretical\npredictions for any context. This is the (static) perspective on BC that we suggest to adopt in future\nresearch. Since BC, as defined here, assess the generalizability of a theory across contexts, our\nunderstanding is fully compatible with the aforementioned conceptions of Bacharach (1989) and\nWhetten (1989) yet more exact and explicit. Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c visualize examples of BC. Figure\n1a depicts an example where the accuracy of theoretical predictions is high for low values of the\ncontext-delineating variable (e.g., accuracy is high for low-velocity markets) and gradually\ndecreases toward high values of the context-delineating variable. Figure 1b considers a case where\naccuracy is high only for medium values of the context-delineating variable and decreases in both\ndirections. Finally, Figure 1c portrays the opposite situation from the one visualized by Figure 1a.\nWe would like to highlight that our conception of BC ties in very closely with the desirable\nproperties of any theory, which are precisely the aforementioned features of accuracy, general\ufffeizability, and simplicity (e.g., Thorngate, 1976; Weick, 1999). Accuracy is reflected in the depen\ufffedent variable inherent to the BC definition, generalizability is embedded in the cross-context\nperspective, and simplicity is determined by the given structure of the theory (which will later on\nalso be regarded as variable). For this reason, we dare hope that the BC concept will henceforth lose\nsome of its surrounding obscurity and will instead become a more integral part of theory develop\ufffement efforts.\nTo further foster conceptual clarity, it seems worthwhile to discuss the relation of BC to closely\nrelated terms. To this aim, Table 2 summarizes the definitions and descriptions of concepts used\nprominently throughout this study. Let us now consider the range (or domain) of a theory. Dubin\n(1978) defines the domain as \u2018\u2018the territory over which we can make truth statements about the\nmodel and, therefore, about the values of the units composing the model\u2019\u2019 (pp. 134-135). We adapt\nthis notion to our definition of BC by specifying it as all those contexts for which the accuracy of\ntheoretical predictions is high. We would also like to distinguish between BC as defined previously\nand the boundary of a theory. We suggest that the boundary of a theory acts as a cutoff point (line,\nsurface, etc.) that identifies the outer end of the range of a theory (depending on the degree to which\nmultidimensionality of context is considered).\nIn his seminal analysis of BC, Bacharach (1989, p. 499) visualized how an entire theory,\ncomprised of constructs and relationships, is constrained by its boundary, thereby raising the\nquestion if it makes sense to consider BC only with respect to an entire theory or also to the\nbuilding blocks of a theory. Dubin (1978) favors the latter perspective: \u2018\u2018The boundary\ufffedetermining criteria of a model apply with equal force to the units employed and the laws of\ninteraction among those units\u2019\u2019 (p. 126). Bacharach shares this view and further elaborates when\nhe requests that constructs should have their \u2018\u2018time and space parameters\u2019\u2019 (p. 502) specified.\nSpecifically, to foster construct clarity, researchers should specify under which contextual con\ufffeditions a proposed construct will or will not apply (Suddaby, 2010). Accordingly, it makes sense to\nthink of boundary conditions of constructs. One of our later empirical examples further substanti\ufffeates this view, also elaborating on the argument of Suddaby (2010) that the meaning of a construct\ncan change from one context to another. Accordingly, we define the range of a construct as\nfollows: The range of a construct denotes those contexts in which the construct can be applied\nwith the same intended meaning. The boundary of the construct is then the outer edge of the\ncontexts beyond which the meaning changes; the BC of a construct can then be conceived as a\nfunction that describes to which degree the meaning is still the same.\nSimilarly, when considering moderating influences, which is the most established form of explor\ufffeing BC, we immediately see that moderators are analyzed for specific causal relationships even\nwhen an entire theory is not widely applicable across contexts. Hence, it is sensible to think of\nrelationships as having their own BC.4 A consideration of BC related to constructs and causal\nrelationships is also practical as it facilitates viewing the BC of a theory as the result of the BC of its components. In other words, any construct or causal relationship may be bounded in terms of\nits cross-context applicability such that it narrows the BC of the theory as a whole. In this vein,\nEdwards and Berry (2010) state: \u2018\u2018Contingencies built into theories increase precision by specifying\nwhen and how the relationships predicted by the theory should vary and whether the theory in toto is\napplicable in particular circumstances\u2019\u2019 (p. 676).\nImportantly, the fact that the BC of an entire theory are shaped by BC of the building blocks of\ntheory (i.e., constructs and causal relationships) does not mean that inference from the BC of the\ntheory to the BC of at least one of the components is possible. For example, in empirical research,\nmodel fit statistics may indicate good fit for a rather complex model in one, rather narrow context but\ndeteriorating fit when context is viewed more broadly. Scholars may not always be able to pin down\nthe exact causes. Moreover, the BC of an entire theory are not simply the narrowest BC of its\ncomponents. Rather, it is reasonable to assume that the lacking consideration of constructs and\nrelationships may also limit the BC of an entire theory.\nIn the past, the BC concept has not been used unanimously. For example, some authors have used\nthe term BC synonymously with limitations (e.g., McNatt & Judge, 2004), a concept that is highly\nmisused, in our view. We define limitations as theoretical and methodological imperfections of a\nstudy that do not question the validity of the respective findings substantially, at least in the\nrespective authors\u2019 view. Examples of limitations are low response rates in survey research, con\ufffevenience sampling in case study research, or lacking empirical realism because of the utilization of\nstudent samples in experimental research. The fact alone that BC relate to a theory (rather than a\nstudy) denotes that BC and limitations are not associated logically with each other. This means, for example, that coercing researchers who conducted a perfectly rigorous case study to lay out sup\ufffeposed \u2018\u2018limitations\u2019\u2019 in terms of limited generalizability of the findings across contexts is inappropri\ufffeate. Rather, limited generalizability is an inherent downside of applying the case method (e.g.,\nGibbert & Ruigrok, 2010) and does not denote a weakness of the study but an unexplored range\nof the theory thus generated.\nOthers have used the notion of BC as a synonym for contingencies or moderators (e.g., Mayer\net al., 2009; Okhuysen & Waller, 2002). We would like to make a distinction again. Moderators are\nan important theoretical tool for exploring BC; however, they are not the only such tool, as this study\nshows. Therefore, they should not be regarded as a synonym for BC. Yet other authors have referred\nto BC by other terms such as scope conditions (e.g., DiMaggio, 1995; Suddaby, 2010). We hope that\nour effort at clarifying the concepts surrounding BC (see Table 2) will help scholars use unambig\ufffeuous terminology in future research.", "length": 3174}
{"prompt": "Summarize this: This case depicts a multifaceted investigation that we conducted to find out why logistics service\nproviders (LSPs) are lacking innovativeness. LSPs are \u2018\u2018companies which perform logistics activ\ufffeities on behalf of others\u2019\u2019 (Delfmann, Albers, & Gehring, 2002, p. 204). Individual LSP firms were\nour unit of analysis, whereas the LSP industry depicts the context that we were specifically inter\ufffeested in (henceforth: \u2018\u2018the LSP context\u2019\u2019). Since LSPs are nested in the LSP industry, context in this\ncase reflects a higher-level variable.\nOur initial interest in this case was contextual (see Table 3), directed at understanding the LSP\ncontext to innovativeness. In other words, we were not aiming to establish any BC; instead, BC\nbecame an important concern over the course of the investigation since the BC associated with our\ninitial theoretical perspective were originally unclear. This case is hence an example for an explo\uffferation of BC under uncertainty (see Table 3). Moreover, it illustrates how the amendment of\nmediators helped make BC more certain (see Figure 3). The initial and the final models are visua\ufffelized in Figure 4.\nInitiation of the Investigation\nPractical interest in the management of LSPs triggered our investigation. At the outset, managers of\nshipping organizations, which are the customers of LSPs, had pointed out to us that on average, LSPs\nare hardly innovative. LSP-related research later confirmed that this capability is frequently lacking\n(Wagner, 2008). The reasons were, however, not apparent. Perplexingly, the literature also provided\nevidence that LSPs operate in innovativeness-fostering environments and that they obtain a number\nof benefits from being innovative. Therefore, an explanation of LSPs\u2019 low innovativeness appeared\nvery useful for corporate practice since it would likely allow the practitioners to derive measures for\nfostering their innovativeness.\nWe did not look at LSPs\u2019 innovativeness from the lens of a grand theory but rather used\naccumulated empirical evidence (Shrivastava, 1987) on the innovativeness-survival relationship\nas our theoretical basis. Previous research has shown that firms\u2019 ability to compete in the market\ufffeplace depends on innovativeness (Damanpour & Gopalakrishnan, 2001) and that indeed, research\nand development activities as an input (Esteve Pe\u00b4rez, Sanchis Llopis, & Sanchis Llopis, 2004) and\ninnovation as an output (Cefis & Marsili, 2006; Damanpour & Gopalakrishnan, 2001) facilitate survival. Correspondingly, \u2018\u2018few issues have been characterized by as much agreement among\norganizational researchers as the importance of innovation to organizational competitiveness and\neffectiveness\u2019\u2019 (Wolfe, 1994, p. 405). At the outset of this investigation, we thus derived a working\nhypothesis from the theory on the innovativeness-survival link according to which firms that strive\nintensively for innovativeness benefit from improved abilities to develop new products, improve\nprocesses, or adapt to environmental necessities such that ultimately, their chances of survival\nincrease. Therefore, according to prior theory, we would expect LSPs to regard innovativeness as\nkey to their survival and strive intensively for innovation. However, counter-stream to this working\nhypothesis and the aforementioned evidence, many LSPs survive without any mentionable innova\ufffetiveness (Wagner, 2008).\nWe were hence facing uncertainty with respect to the question if the prior theory holds in our\ncontext or not (see Table 3). Because of this misalignment between the predictions of the theory and\nthe situation in our context of interest, we suspected that industry (i.e., belonging to the LSP industry\nor not) might have to be added as a moderator to the relation between striving for innovativeness and\nsurvival (see Figure 4). However, no reasons were apparent that could explain this possible mod\ufffeeration effect.\nResearch Design and Process\nAs the theoretical literature on the innovativeness-survival relationship did not yet depict or explain\nany industry moderation effects, it stood in apparent conflict with our prior knowledge on the LSP\ncontext. Therefore, we were worried that the range of this theory might not stretch far enough to\ninclude our context for reasons that we did not understand. Due to the seemingly special nature of the\nLSP context, we were generally very cautious about the extent to which our research was informed\nby prior literature throughout this investigation. Therefore, it seemed logical to apply a highly\nexploratory research design.\nOur investigation was motivated by an expectation that (a) the LSP context surrounding innova\ufffetion would be special and (b) there would be differences between LSPs and other service providers.\nThese two factors are closely intertwined but point in slightly different directions, with the former\ncalling for open-minded and unbiased exploration of LSPs\u2019 innovativeness context, whereas the\nlatter suggests for cross-context comparisons. These factors also required different data to be\nanalyzed, with the former needing qualitative factors characterizing the LSP context and the latter\nrequiring quantitative comparisons. Over the course of the investigation, we reviewed the related\ncontext-specific and context-unspecific literature, analyzed the distinctiveness of LSPs and logis\ufffetical services vis-a`-vis other service providers and other services, studied innovation management at\nthe levels of the firm and the innovation process, and computed and compared various input-, output-,\nand outcome-related innovativeness indicators. When our research question was finally answered to\nour full satisfaction, we had conducted four distinct studies that built on each other in a stepwise\nfashion to facilitate a comprehensive explanation. The empirical database for each study was compiled\nin Germany; therefore, the legal and cultural context could not confound the results. The research\nprocess was rather wicked.\nWe began first by exploring LSPs\u2019 context by means of a highly interactive workshop series in\nwhich we discussed the applicability of extant innovation management concepts at \u2018\u2018typical\u2019\u2019 LSPs\nwith seven managers from four logistics service providers. Over the course of the workshops, the\npractitioners increasingly directed attention to the processes of innovation generation at LSPs. All\npractitioners agreed that overall, LSPs are only marginally innovative. Among the participants, we\ndiscussed seven extant, supposedly context-independent innovation process models that we refined\nto match the LSP context. From the practitioners\u2019 assessments of applicability at their firms, three\nLSP-related variables emerged (high customer dependence, high dispersion, adverse innovation mentality of personnel), which needed to be integrated into a refined, LSP-specific model of how\ninnovation generation processes evolve. These variables had obstructing rather than facilitating\neffects within innovation processes, which later led us to conclude that innovation management\nwithin LSPs tends to be particularly costly.\nHaving found some support for our ex ante expectation of a specific context at LSPs, we began a\nliterature review on innovation management at LSPs that employed content analysis. Our intention\nwas to better understand the peculiarities of LSPs\u2019 firm- and process-level innovation management.\nUpon investigation, contextual boundaries were discovered to be slightly blurry since, for example,\nlogistics departments within industrial firms may occasionally act so independently that they can be\nregarded as \u2018\u2018internal LSPs.\u2019\u2019 After careful consideration of its applicability, we found it possible to\ncategorize the data with a useful framework from the general innovation management literature\n(Adams, Bessant, & Phelps, 2006). The categorized prior literature helped us understand some\ncharacteristic features of LSPs\u2019 innovation context, such as an inherent difficulty to innovate the\nmost basic elements of logistical services (i.e., acts of transportation, handling of goods, and ware\ufffehousing), but it did not fully explain the differences between LSPs and other service providers. Thus,\nfurther studies were required.\nNext, we conducted an in-depth study of 13 cases of LSPs\u2019 firm-level innovation management,\naiming to establish a link to each firm\u2019s respective internal and external context. Six context factors\nwere identified. Three of them reflected and hence confirmed the factors from our initial study,\nanother three were not identified therein (organizational size, importance of technology, and growth\npotential). With the help of some data from a statistical yearbook, it was possible to conclude that\nthose additional factors were relevant at the level of the individual firm only. This means that there\nwas some variance at the level of the individual firms that does not have an average or typical value\nthat characterizes the context of LSPs as a whole.\nAt this point, we concluded that a view focused on LSPs, only with relatively indirect cross\ufffecontext comparisons based on implicit understandings of other contexts, would not be sufficient to\nfully answer the research question. Therefore, another study was amended that compared input-,\noutput-, and outcome-related innovativeness indicators of LSPs and other service providers, using a\nhigh-quality secondary database. Significant and substantially meaningful differences between LSPs\nand other service providers were identified and explored. The central conclusion was that for LSPs,\ninnovation efforts are as beneficial as for other service providers but more costly to conduct. This\nfinding triggered the refinement of the initially suspected moderation model into a moderated\nmediation model, as depicted in Figure 4.\nJointly, the results of the four, internally consistent studies facilitated deriving a holistic explana\ufffetion of the lack of innovativeness experienced by LSPs compared to other service providers. The\nholistic view allowed us to pin down exactly what was special about the LSP context and why.\nResults\nPrior theory on the innovativeness-survival link strongly emphasized benefits associated with inno\ufffevativeness, whereas it spoke hardly about costs. Our initial working hypothesis derived from this\nliterature was hence that firms should choose suitable antecedents (A) (e.g., deliberate investments\ninto innovativeness as an organizational capability) so as to enjoy the benefits (B) associated with\ninnovativeness (e.g., the abilities to construct innovative products and implement efficient pro\ufffecesses) in order to ultimately foster survival (S) (i.e., A ! B ! S). The seeming contradiction that\nmany LSPs survive without striving for or demonstrating innovativeness (SLSPs \u00bc high, BLSPs \u00bc low,\nALSPs \u00bc low) motivated us to explore the LSP context to innovation in depth and suspect that\nindustry might be an important moderator to the aforementioned causal chain. The exploration of\nthe LSP context led us to conclude that costs also matter as an additional mediator between innovativeness-related efforts and survival (i.e., A ! C ! S). Mostly by serendipity, the structure of\nour secondary database allowed us to posit that the benefits for LSPs and other service providers are\nsimilar (i.e., the A ! B relation features a similar \u2018\u2018effect strength\u2019\u2019), whereas innovation efforts are\ninherently more costly for LSPs than for other service providers (i.e., the A ! C relationship features\na \u2018\u2018stronger effect\u2019\u2019 for LSPs) because of certain characteristics of logistical services, LSPs, and the\nenvironmental conditions under which LSPs operate. If we look at firm survival in terms of \u2018\u2018not\ngoing bankrupt,\u2019\u2019 it is immediately clear that costs affect survival negatively, whereas the benefits\nassociated with innovation influence it positively. Therefore, the overall model that we derived can,\nin abstract terms, be regarded as a competitive mediation model (Zhao, Lynch, & Chen, 2010),\nwhich is also a moderated mediation model (Hayes, 2013) because the A ! C relationship is\nmoderated by the industry context.\nThis explanation may sound simple, but that is primarily because it is an ex post explanation.\nBear in mind that the range of the prior theory on the innovativeness-survival link was unclear. In\nother words, it was unclear in which contexts the implication \u2018\u2018if you want to survive, then you\nshould aim to be innovative\u2019\u2019 holds. There are many industry contexts in which innovativeness is\nindeed so obviously necessary (e.g., high-tech firms or Internet firms) that the associated benefits\npresumably overcompensate for the costs. In these contexts, the theory as a whole can be viewed in a\nsimplified manner as A ! S, with an overall \u2018\u2018positive effect\u2019\u2019 of A for each context within the range.\nHowever, this \u2018\u2018coarse\u2019\u2019 theory becomes an oversimplification outside of its range where both of the\nmediation paths need to be viewed and balanced against each other (Busse et al., 2016). In this\nmanner, the investigation clarified the BC of the initial theory and developed the theory further.\nThese two processes were even so intertwined that it is difficult to disaggregate them afterward. The\nrefined model, which is depicted in Figure 4, is more generalizable and more accurate than the\noriginal model yet less simple, as the theoretical-methodological analysis suggested (see Figure 3).\nIn line with our related statement in the theoretical-methodological analysis section, it was not the\namendment of the moderator to the structure of the theory that made the difference in the BC\nexploration. The necessity to amend this moderator seemed apparent from the outset of this inves\ufffetigation so as to maintain fit with the innovativeness-survival theory, but it was impossible to make\nsense of (i.e., theorize on) this \u2018\u2018required\u2019\u2019 moderation effect. Rather, it was the amendment of the\ncompeting mediating pathways between the independent and the dependent variable that allowed us\nto develop a theoretical rationale for the influence of the industry context, as per the earlier analysis\nof this theoretical tool.", "length": 3401}
{"prompt": "Below is the payment determinzation algotrhism for an healthcare alternative payment model. I need you to write Stata code to create a dataset with simulated ACR, UAMCC, and DAH measure scores. the ACR measure has 1010 observations, following a normal distribution ranging from 14 to 17; the UAMCC measure has 1005 observations, following a uniform distribution ranging from 45 to 85; the DAH measure has 1000 observations, ranging from 250 to 350 following a normal distribution. The variable that captures unique healthcare org ID is DCE\\_ID. Please make sure none of the DCE has all the three measure scores missing. Then create a Stata code to apply to this simulated dataset, to compute the Final Earn-Back Rate for every DCE. If a DCE has missing scores for all relevant quality measures, give them a P4P score=missing. Please use the benchmark information in \"Table 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\"\n -------1.1 Application of Quality Assessment to Final Financial Reconciliation\nThe process of determining the impact of quality measurement and performance on the PY Benchmark is summarized in this section using PY2022 as an example. The steps are as follows:\n\n\u2022 CMS develops Quality Benchmarks for each P4P measure.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are calculated: P4R Quality Measures are assessed, and P4P Quality Measures are compared against their Quality Benchmarks to determine performance levels.\n\u2022 Component Quality Scores are weighted to calculate the Total Quality Score.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) CI/SEP criteria are assessed to determine the amount of the Quality Withhold to which the Total Quality Score will be applied.\n\u2022 (PY2023\u2013PY2026 only) HPP funds are distributed.\n\n1.1.1 Step 1. CMS Develops Quality Benchmarks for Each P4P Measure\nIn PY2022, ACR and UAMCC will have P4P components. These measures assess the occurrence of undesirable outcomes\u2014thus, lower measure scores represent better performance. Performance levels for each DCE are determined by comparing their Quality Measure scores with the relevant Quality Benchmark. The DCE earns a performance level for each measure based on where the measure score falls in comparison to the benchmark threshold values.\n\nTable 2-6 presents hypothetical Quality Benchmark distributions for Standard/New Entrant DCEs (using historical Medicare claims data) for both P4P measures. For example, a DCE with a measure score or risk-standardized readmission rate (RSRR) of 15.10% for ACR would be in the 50th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the 60th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 50th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score or RSRR of 15.60% for ACR would be in the 20th percentile group for that measure (the score exceeds the threshold for the\n25th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 20th percentile group). A DCE with a measure score of 74.89 admissions per 100 person-years for UAMCC would be in the 10th percentile group (the score exceeds the threshold for the 15th percentile group but is less than the maximum threshold for the 10th percentile group).\n\nTable 2-6. Hypothetical Benchmark Distributions for ACR and UAMCC for Comparison with Standard and New Entrant DCE Measure Scores\n\nPercentile 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nACR 16.34 15.99 15.79 15.68 15.57 15.47 15.31 15.18 15.08 14.95 14.82 14.6\nUAMCC 82.5 75.23 71.08 68.43 66.67 64.68 61.2 58.48 55.98 53.37 50.16 46.12\n\nPlease note that Table 2-6 presents an example only. These are not the final Quality Benchmarks and are not intended to provide an indication of the final Quality Benchmarks. Historically, Quality Benchmarks for other models have been released prior to the start of a given PY. However, observed and anticipated changes in utilization and outcomes resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 have made it inappropriate to use data from 2020 for Quality Benchmarking. Given the likelihood of ongoing impacts on current and future PYs, CMMI is taking a different approach for GPDC quality benchmarking.\n \n\nFor PY2021, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will not be released until June 2022 and will be based on a hybrid approach, combining historical and concurrent data from two discontinuous 12-month periods, the calendar years 2019 and 2021. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2021 will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023.\n\nFor PY2022, GPDC Quality Benchmarks will shift to being based only on data from the 12-month period concurrent with the performance year. Starting with the first quarterly quality report for PY2022, CMMI will provide provisional quality benchmarks to DCEs in their quarterly reports, which will be calculated based on data from the same reporting period (i.e., April 1, 2021-March 31, 2022 for PY2022 Q1). The provisional benchmarks will be updated in each subsequent quarterly report with data from the same period being used to calculate DCE\u2019s performance. Because the DCE performance and benchmarks will be based on the same time-period and have the same exact risk adjustment coefficients, DCEs will have a more accurate picture from quarter to quarter of their performance relative to the benchmark. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate for PY2022 will be based on quality benchmarks calculated using data from calendar year 2022 and will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023. As with the hybrid approach for PY2021, the use of concurrent benchmarks for PY2022 will avoid potential coronavirus disease 2019 impacts.\n\n1.1.2 Step 2. Component Quality Scores Are Calculated: P4R Quality Measures Are Assessed, and P4P Quality Measures Are Compared against Their Quality Benchmarks to Determine Performance Levels\nP4R Component: For PY2022, 4% of the 5% Quality Withhold is associated with P4R. The claims-based measures of ACR, UAMCC, and DAH (for High Needs Population DCEs only) comprise 2% of the Quality Withhold, and the CAHPS Measure comprises 2%. There are therefore two Component Quality Scores associated with P4R, one for the claims-based measures, and one for CAHPS.\n\u2022 All DCEs will meet the requirement for the claims-based measures and automatically earn a Component Quality Score of 100% for the portion of the withhold tied to the P4R claims-based measures in Table 2-3.\n\u2022 All DCEs that authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 100%. DCEs that do not authorize a survey vendor to conduct the CAHPS Survey will receive a P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS of 0%. DCEs that are exempt from CAHPS will have a single P4R Component Quality Score of 100%.\nP4P Component: The PY2022 P4P component will be the same as PY2021, which combines the ACR and UAMCC measures. The highest performance level (i.e., percentile) achieved for either Quality Measure determines the P4P Component Quality Score. Furthermore, the P4P component is considered pass/fail\u2014all DCEs with at least one measure at or exceeding the 30th percentile will pass and receive a 100% Component Quality Score.\n\nAs in PY2021, in PY2022, a sliding scale approach will be applied to DCEs that do not meet the 30th percentile threshold on at least one of the two measures. The sliding scale allows DCEs to earn back at\n \n\nleast a portion of the 1% withhold, based on their highest measure performance. The details of the sliding scales are presented in Table 2-7. In the example in Step 1 above, where a DCE achieved the 20th percentile for ACR and the 10th percentile for UAMCC, the DCE would receive a P4P Component Quality Score of 80%.\n\nTable 2-7. Sliding Scale Earn-Back for P4P Component Quality Score, PY2021 and PY2022\n\nPercentile Met P4P Component Quality Score\n\u2265 30th 100%\n25th to < 30th 95%\n20th to < 25th 80%\n15th to < 20th 60%\n10th to < 15th 40%\n5th to < 10th 20%\n< 5th 0%\n1.1.3 Step 3. Component Quality Scores Are Weighted to Calculate the Total Quality Score\nAfter assessing P4R measures and determining performance levels for each P4P measure, CMS calculates Component Quality Scores for each DCE. The component weight is the proportion of the overall Quality Withhold tied to that component. In PY2022, there are three Component Quality Scores. The first component is P4P, based on ACR and UAMCC. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5, contributing 1% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The second component is P4R for claims-based measures and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. The third component is P4R for CAHPS and has a weight of 2/5, contributing 2% out of the 5% Quality Withhold. Note that additional P4P components (such as DAH) will be added in subsequent years.\n\nThe Total Quality Score is the percentage of the Quality Withhold eligible for earn-back that a DCE will actually earn back based on its quality performance and reporting. The Total Quality Score is calculated as the sum of the products of the Component Quality Scores and component weights, as shown in the equation below.\n\nTotal Quality Score = \u2211 (Component Quality Scores \\* Component Weights)\n\nIn our example above, the DCE receives a P4P Component Quality Score of 80% based on the sliding scale. The same DCE receives a P4R Component Quality Score for claims-based measures of 100%. This DCE also authorized a CAHPS Survey vendor, earning 100% of the P4R Component Quality Score for CAHPS. The P4P component has a weight of 1/5 and the P4R components each have a weight of 2/5. The Total Quality Score for this DCE is (80% \\* 1/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) + (100% \\* 2/5) = 96%.\n\n1.1.4 Step 4. Total Quality Score Is Multiplied by the Eligible Earn-Back Rate to Determine a DCE\u2019s\nFinal Earn-Back Rate\nIn PY2022, the Eligible Earn-Back Rate will be 5% for all DCEs. A DCE with a Total Quality Score of 96% will have a Final Earn-Back Rate of 4.8%. A DCE\u2019s Final Earn-Back Rate will be determined during final reconciliation, which will occur in 2023 for PY2022. The steps for the example described in this section, starting with Section 2.5, are summarized in Table 3-1.", "length": 3084}

{"prompt": "ok, this ic chapter one : \nThe Ice Cream Cone That Changed My Life\nome couples fight about money, but my ex-husband and I had an even bigger problem: we didn\u2019t talk about it at all.\nHe would give me his paycheck and I would pay the bills, and while that might sound like we were Adults of the Year, what we really were was clueless. Plans? What were those? We were winging it daily, neither one of us caring enough about our finances to even have a conversation.\nThe day I got pregnant, however, we were finally forced to take a harder look at things. How were we going to afford a baby? I told myself we would make it work; we would find ways to be thrifty. I painted the nursery walls myself, a light green color, with paint I found in the clearance section at Home Depot. I watched DIY videos on YouTube and tutorials on Pinterest. I made bookshelves from old rain gutters and made all of the artwork for the baby\u2019s bedroom out of construction paper and Crayola markers. I was determined to create special memories with the little money we had. It would be fine; we would just wing it like we always did.\nBut then I actually had the baby.\n \nIf you\u2019ve ever looked into the eyes of a newborn, you know it upends everything you thought about what matters. For the first time, \u201cday by day\u201d was not good enough. \u201cSeat of my pants\u201d was not good enough. My son, James, made me long for an all-new sense of stability, a life that was beautiful, intentional, safe, and designed.\nEnter the moment I decided I needed a budget. A real one. Not the flimsy, just-for-decoration kind, but the kind that would actually help us strategically move forward as a family.\nThis sounded like a reasonable idea\u2014you know, financial goals and all\u2014until I realized my husband and I were on totally different teams. We had finally started talking about money, but every time we did, it would result in a fight. We never had any clear purpose or bigger ambitions. There I was, cycling through various types of budgeting methods, looking for one that would actually make us better with our money\u2014from percentage based to monthly based and beyond\u2014but by the end of each month, we would pay our bills on time but have nothing left over. It was a constant, never-ending struggle.\nSoon, our debt became unmanageable. We had one or two credit cards totaling $6,000, and I had ballooning student loans, and medical bills from a severe motorcycle accident. But I still managed to make what little progress I could, taking advantage of balance transfers, filing for financial hardship with the hospital, and getting on an income-based repayment plan for my student loans. Eventually\u2014 with enough focus and discipline\u2014I was able to pay it all off and was so incredibly proud. I hadn\u2019t achieved everything I wanted, but I was getting by. I was making it work.\nBut then the divorce happened.\nAs a kid, I lived through my parents\u2019 separation, and it was one of the most defining moments of my youth. I remember the suffering it caused my mom. I watched as fear took over her life. The hurt I felt had ripple effects straight through to adulthood.\n \nSo when I found myself in the position of initiating my own divorce, all I felt was heart-clenching failure. To complicate matters, the logistics of it all were herculean: it was near impossible to find a place of my own with an annual income of only $30,000 from my job as an assistant in the finance industry. With a little luck, I did finally find an eight-hundred-square-foot apartment. For several months, it was mostly empty. I left my marriage with only a few bags of belongings, so we didn\u2019t have any furniture. I managed to buy a TV from Walmart with one of my paychecks, and we watched that TV nightly, eating our dinner on the living room floor. Divorce is complicated and difficult for many obvious reasons, but for me, the loneliness hit hard. When I was married, there was togetherness. Finances together, struggles together, stories together, dinners together. But then it was just me. It felt lonely, scary, and dark.\nMore than the loneliness, however, was the guilt. Even though I knew that this decision was best for our family, I also knew I had stripped away everything my son had known: a backyard, his own bedroom, his toys, the swing set. I was in a constant panic about how he was handling the new changes, and because of that panic, the problem compounded: I kept trying to live a life that wasn\u2019t mine. I wanted to pretend like everything was normal. I wanted to pretend like I still had it together, that nothing had changed. I wanted to give my son the life he deserved. And so out of a complex emotional cocktail of shame, guilt, and fear, one morning I woke up, took the day off work, and ordered brand-new furniture on my credit card.\nA lot of furniture.\nI was desperate to prove I was a good mom. So desperate, in fact, that I also decided to order some fresh new decor while I was at it (no more construction paper and Crayola for us)\u2014not to mention a new microwave, pots and pans, ALL new kitchen gadgets, and a brand-new bed. Do you know how expensive beds are?\nI\u2019m sure it comes as no surprise that I immediately maxed out my limit. That\u2019s when I made the grand decision to start accepting credit\n \ncard offers I received in the mail. I thought to myself, \u201cI can pay this off over the next year, it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d In my mind, it was about building a home my son loved and felt comfortable in, a safe and happy place. But, in reality, I was spending money I didn\u2019t have in order to feel like I was living up to my own standards of what I thought a good mom was.\nThe total damage from my \u201cgood mom binge\u201d came to over\n$20,000 worth of crippling, high-interest debt. Coupled with the shiny new Jeep Patriot I brilliantly drove right off the lot right before my divorce, I soon found myself suddenly owing seventy-eight thousand United States dollars. There I was, still living day by day, still making frivolous financial decisions I rationalized as helpful ones.\nOf course, I never thought I\u2019d have my big moment of truth in a McDonald\u2019s drive-through.\nWe were at the park. My son wanted ice cream. We got in the car and drove to the closest McDonald\u2019s. I pulled up to the window and ordered one. I will never forget the price: $1.09. As I went to pay, I reached inside my wallet and pulled out my debit card, but then hesitated: I didn\u2019t even know if I had $1.09 in my checking account. So I took out my credit card instead. I financed a $1.09 ice cream cone for my son.\nAnd suddenly, for the first time, I saw everything with intense, painful clarity.\nAs I looked back at him, happily licking away, I got mad. Sometimes, the truth will anger you, but it\u2019ll always be what saves you. In that moment I knew I was going to have to fight harder for a life he could be proud of that didn\u2019t involve shame, poverty, and the endless financial stress spiral I was putting us through. I wanted him to be able to experience life without the constant emotional struggle, to be able to actually live\u2014or at least order an ice cream cone without being traumatized. I didn\u2019t want to model unhealthy behaviors. I didn\u2019t want him to feel the side effects of my less-than- stellar choices.\n \nI was also tired of being endlessly preoccupied with money, never knowing how much I had in my checking account, constantly stressing, stressing, stressing, and never being present with him because my mind was always somewhere else.\nThis was one of those moments when you realize you no longer have a choice. Being financially successful went from being a \u201cnice to have\u201d to an urgent necessity. And the very first thing I knew I\u2019d have to do?\nGet serious about understanding money.\nI needed to get serious about making it, strategizing it, planning it, and using it.\nAnd I needed a real budget that worked.\nIt\u2019s not that I hadn\u2019t tried to make one work in the past; I had tried. But none of them seemed set up for living in the real world. And perhaps that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know then what I know now: that budgeting isn\u2019t hard because of the budget, but because of the rules. Change the rules, change the outcome. I had a lot to learn.\nIn the meantime, however, I knew I needed to try something\u2014 anything. So I began to experiment. I scrapped what I thought I \u201cshould\u201d do, and instead focused on what actually felt useful and helpful . . . for me. For example, instead of throwing every dollar toward my debt and eating nothing but rice and beans for three years\u2014common wisdom in the budgeting world\u2014I confronted my emotional spending head-on. I realized low self-esteem caused me to overspend, so instead of going to the mall when I felt low, I put on a pair of sneakers and went for a run. Little by little, I took note of where I was making progress and what didn\u2019t seem to work in the context of my life. And little by little, my new personal budgeting method\u2014one that plucked the most useful ideas from traditional approaches and combined them into a new hybrid method that was aligned with my goals instead of everybody else\u2019s\u2014was born.\nAnd by the end of my experiment, I didn\u2019t just have a budget: I had freedom and fulfillment.\n \nI had hope again.\n\u2014\nere\u2019s the thing about budgeting that most people don\u2019t realize:\nIt\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about you. Budgeting is personal development in disguise.\nIf you know what you want from your money, progress can happen\n\u2014no matter how much (or how little) of it you have. The thing is, most of us don\u2019t understand what we really want from our money.\nWhen I was in that McDonald\u2019s parking lot all those years ago, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted. I was copying and pasting other people\u2019s goals into my life, assuming theirs were as good as any. It took years of experimentation, self-exploration, and asking myself hard questions to finally figure out that I could want other things. That I did want other things. And I needed to learn to use money as a tool to pursue my dreams instead of react to my fears.\nBudgeting forces you to understand yourself in all-new ways because it asks you to decide what you want to actually accomplish with your money beyond simply \u201cpaying the bills.\u201d I had to define what success felt and looked like in my own life, and learn how to address the underlying issues of what was really causing my out-of- control spending. It wasn\u2019t because I desperately needed a new mirror from Target.\nEvery single day I looked at my son, and every single day my purpose became clearer. I started budgeting my money differently, doing it every time I got paid, and designed a physical budgeting calendar that allowed me to see my finances from a new perspective. Eventually I started using a zero-based budget\u2014we\u2019ll talk more about that soon\u2014which gave me the control I needed to allocate every dollar toward things that mattered to me and my life. Nothing was arbitrary. Every dollar was spoken for.\nAnd it worked.\n \nPress fast-forward on this story, and my life now is nothing like what it once was. I wouldn\u2019t have believed you if you\u2019d told me that day in the McDonald\u2019s drive-through that in the future I\u2019d be the Budget Mom, a world-renowned personal finance expert, blogger, and author who has millions of followers from all around the world. Or that I am finally in a place where I don\u2019t have to think about money. I spend time with my son every day. I\u2019m able to send him to sports camps and social events when they come up. Last year, I took a gorgeous vacation with my mom. And most recently?\nI paid for our brand-new home in cash.\nThis is the \u201chappily ever after\u201d part of what I call Budget by Paycheck, the name of the system I ultimately designed to help other women who have lost their way with their finances. My business and website are not only a business and blog: they\u2019re a community of women from around the world. And we\u2019re not just \u201cbudgeting\u201d\u2014we\u2019re building. We\u2019re using our desires to design our money and take back control of our lives.\nIt might be difficult for you to envision a life you might never have experienced, one without the question of \u201cWill I have enough?\u201d constantly hanging over your head. One where you don\u2019t have to be afraid of emergencies. One where you can say with pride, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nBut trust me, if it was possible for a girl who was once so broke she had to decide whether to pay the rent or put food on the table, it\u2019s possible for you, too.\nInside these pages, I\u2019m going to teach you how to view money as an engine instead of an enemy. The reason so many other financial programs get it wrong is that they focus on the numbers and miss what actually matters: you, your life, your family, and what makes you actually feel joyful, happy, confident, and free. Not just financially free, but truly free to live well.\nLife > money. Having options is better than any dollar amount in your bank account. Spending time with your kids. Giving back to\n \nyour family. Making unforgettable memories. Living without financial anxiety. Trusting in yourself. And being able to be present for the million moments that make up your day.\nBudgeting isn\u2019t about restricting your spending; it\u2019s about expanding your options. It\u2019s about your quality of life. It\u2019s about peace, pleasure, and triumph. It\u2019s about feeling fulfilled, and creating big, beautiful memories\u2014no matter how small your budget.\nIt\u2019s about being confident. It\u2019s about being strong.\nIt\u2019s about being true to you.\nAnd it\u2019s about loving yourself in ways you never have before.", "length": 3377}

{"prompt": "The moderating e\ufb00ect of communication on congruence and incongruence of openness to change: is communication always bene\ufb01cial for learning organization culture and knowledge sharing? Abstract Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this study was to explore the moderating role of communication in the relationship between person-organization \ufb01t (P-O \ufb01t) of openness to change, learning organization and knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A total of 1,015 faculty and staff participants from three private universities in South Korea was included in the analysis. Individual and organizational aspects of openness to change were examined based on the P-O \ufb01t theory. Moderated polynomial regression and response surface methodology were used for data analysis. Findings \u2013 At a higher level of communication, the congruence of openness to change between the individual and organization showed a positive \ufb01t effect on learning organization. The incongruence of openness to change between individual and organization, in which the organizations\u2019 openness to change was higher than that of individuals, decreased the level of knowledge sharing when the level of communication was higher. Originality/value \u2013 The results of this study support the theory and practice that consideration of P-O \ufb01t on openness to change and a strategic approach of communication are needed to succeed in organizational change. Keywords Person-organization \ufb01t, Communication, Polynomial regression Paper type Research paper Introduction In an environment where conditions are constantly changing and expectations are vague, organizations must be able to adapt quickly and deftly (Lewis, 2019). For an organization in higher education to be in a stable state for change, it needs to disperse its structure. Universities often are regarded as loosely coupled organizations because of their autonomous culture, but they are tightly coupled (Orton and Weick, 1990). Although university members such as faculty and administrative staff seem to be open to change, the policies and regulations of the university organization are based rigidly on a central strategy. As an important \ufb01rst step of successful change, an organization should be sensitive and open to change at different levels of the organization (Zhu and Engels, 2014). Based on person-organization \ufb01t (P-O \ufb01t) theory (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005), openness to change between individuals and organizations can be congruent or incongruent. Openness to change at an individual level requires a personal attitude that is ready for change based on the individual\u2019s motivation (Choi and Ruona, 2011; Devos et al., 2007; Wanberg and Banas, 2000). Openness to change at an organizational level is based on the organizational culture and climate among the organization\u2019s members. However, many studies have focused on either the individual or organizational level of openness to change (Choi and Ruona, 2011; Jeong et al., 2016). Thus, the perceptions on openness to change at both the individual and organizational levels, as well as their P-O \ufb01t or mis\ufb01t, need to be considered. Most research suggests that learning at the organizational level and knowledge sharing at the individual level accelerate organizational change (Park and Kim, 2018). Whether a university can respond to organizational changes based on learning and knowledge sharing can be different from the purpose of university education itself. The concept of learning organization is one of the most suitable formats of organizational culture for continued change (Watkins and Marsick, 1993; Yang et al., 2004). In addition, changes can be implemented by knowledge-sharing behaviors at an individual level. Self-motivated behavior, such as knowledge sharing, is one of the most important factors in the process of change. Depending on the P-O \ufb01t of openness to change, the levels of learning organization and knowledge sharing can be perceived differently. The current study focuses on how congruence or incongruence in openness to change between individuals and organizations in\ufb02uences learning organization and knowledge sharing, which are critical to successful organizational change. In addition, because communication-based organizational change is needed for ef\ufb01cient systematic innovation (De Ridder, 2004), it is worth investigating the role of communication in accelerating or hindering change in the dynamics of organizational change. Communication can act as a reinforcing factor in P-O \ufb01t or a deteriorating factor in P-O mis\ufb01t depending on the circumstances. The primary purpose of this study is to explore the moderating role of communication in the relationship between openness to change, learning organization and knowledge sharing. Based on the results of this study, organizations such as universities need to understand P-O \ufb01t and use appropriate communication strategies according to the PO \ufb01t context to increase learning organization and knowledge sharing for successful organizational innovation. Literature review Person-organization \ufb01 t of openness to change An organization\u2019s drive to change depends on its employees\u2019 openness to change. Openness to change has been conceptualized as individuals\u2019 attitudes that speci\ufb01cally form from their motivations to change (Choi and Ruona, 2011). Openness to change is a prerequisite to employee readiness for successful changes planned in an organization (Devos et al., 2007; Wanberg and Banas, 2000). An individual with a low level of openness to change considers change to be a risk and a source of anxiety (Miller et al., 1994), whereas one with a high level of openness to change perceives change as natural and a good opportunity for development (Choi and Ruona, 2011). Openness to change needs to be viewed at both the individual and organizational levels. Many change efforts focus on system-level variables in an organization but undervalue the importance of the individual perspective on organizational change, for which people are the ones to implement changes (Devos et al., 2007). Understanding the \ufb01t of openness to change between individuals and organizations helps to elucidate the underlying phenomena of organizational change. The \ufb01t in values or attitudes between employees and their organization has been studied in the P-O \ufb01t literature (Afsar, 2016; Kristof, 1996). P-O \ufb01t of openness to change between the members and the organization is viewed as supplementary \ufb01 t, which is determined by shared characteristics in values or attitudes (Kristof, 1996). P-O \ufb01t can play a positive or negative role depending on an organization\u2019s circumstances. In general, it has been argued that congruence between individuals and organizations is positive, but the level of congruence has been overlooked (Edwards, 1995). The congruence of values between individuals and organizations can be a hindrance in the process of organizational change when the levels are all low. For example, in the case of congruence with a low level of openness to change for both individuals and the organization, there will be little effort to change or innovate within an organization. To better understand P-O \ufb01t of openness to change, it is important to consider the in\ufb02uence of various combinations of congruence or incongruence levels between individuals and organizations. Person-organization \ufb01 t of openness to change, learning organization and knowledge sharing For organizational change to be successful, a learning organization and knowledge sharing are essential. At the organizational level, as several studies have shown, learning organization is critical for innovation, supported by a collectively shared vision and \ufb02exible organizational structures (Park et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2004). Learning organizations are organic and \ufb02exible entities in which new ideas and approaches are welcome. An open attitude to change is a key precondition for learning organizations because it is one of the most welcoming attitudes to new ideas. Organizational members who are open to change search for new solutions to organizational issues with different methods and procedures (Kontoghiorghes et al., 2005). Openness to change in a learning organization is the process for intended organizational change. Thus, openness to change is clearly essential in a learning organization. In terms of P-O \ufb01t of openness to change, there would be two cases: high-high or low-low for congruence and high-low or low-high for incongruence. In an example of a congruence case, when individuals perceive themselves and their organizations to have a high level of openness to change, they might perceive their organization as a learning organization. However, when individuals consider both parties to have a low level of openness to change, they might not classify their organization as a learning organization. At the individual level, knowledge sharing is at the core of creating new values in an organization for continued survival (Bock and Kim, 2002). Knowledge sharing is de\ufb01ned as an individual\u2019s willing behavior to share their knowledge to support other colleagues and to collaborate with others for solving problems or developing new ideas (Gibbert and Krause, 2002). By sharing knowledge that is pertinent to tasks within and between departments, new approaches can be found for long-term problems that prevent organizational change and development. Many studies have identi\ufb01ed major factors that facilitate knowledge sharing, including individual motivation, beliefs and attitudes, as well as organizational culture and climate (Ipe, 2003; Wang and Noe, 2010). Cabrera et al. (2006) found that openness among individual attitudes is positively related to knowledge sharing. Hinds and Pfeffer (2003) argued that individuals with a high level of openness tend to have a high degree of interest in sharing their ideas and insights as well as seeking ideas and insights from others. In addition, openness within the organizational climate positively in\ufb02uences knowledge sharing to some degree. In sum, knowledge sharing cannot be forced by an organization and might depend on individual motivations because knowledge resides in individuals rather than in organizations (Bock et al., 2005; Hinds and Pfeffer, 2003). The P-O \ufb01t of openness to change between individuals and organizations should be considered when knowledge sharing is examined in relation to openness to change. When individuals have low levels and the organization has a high level of openness to change among P-O \ufb01t cases of incongruence (i.e. high-low; low-high), the organization has a limited ability to demand that individuals share their knowledge. This is because knowledge sharing is determined primarily by individual behavior and interactions among individuals. Various interpretations of the P-O \ufb01t combinations are possible to study the in\ufb02uence of openness to change on knowledge sharing. In sum, even if openness to change in\ufb02uences knowledge sharing, whether the P-O \ufb01t on openness is congruent or incongruent leads to different results in the degree of knowledge sharing. A combination of congruence and incongruence for the P-O \ufb01t can lead to a variety of results in which openness to change affects knowledge sharing. Moderating e \ufb00 ects of organizational communication Organizational communication is one of the most effective strategies for an organization to achieve a successful innovation by accepting and distributing new ideas and approaches. Organizational communication includes managerial and interpersonal forms of communication that allow members to recognize and participate in changes to policies, strategies and instructions (Gochhayat et al., 2017). When members receive quality information related to their tasks and organizational changes, they better understand change processes. Researchers have agreed that communication, such as inclusion in decision-making, is a critical component of any successful plan for organizational change (Schweiger and Denisi, 1991; Lewis and Seibold, 1998). In addition, organizational communication helps to create and share an organization\u2019s values (Wiesenfeld et al., 1998). Therefore, the values and attitudes such as openness to change can be dispersed across the organization. Barker and Camarata (1998) asserted that all forms of organizational communication are critical in a learning organization when the environment is rapidly changing. Organizational communication helps an organization to evolve by generating insights and seeking agreement for organizational change. In an organization with active organizational communication, increasing the openness to change of individuals and organizations results in a better perception of learning organizations. In other words, the will for change is recognized more through organizational communication, through which the perception will arise that the organization is a learning organization that constantly pursues change. The perception of a learning organization can vary when the levels of openness to change between individuals and organizations are not the same. Thus, it is necessary to explore how the impact of P-O \ufb01t for openness to change on the perception of a learning organization varies according to the active level of organizational communication: H1. The positive effect of congruence of openness to change on a learning organization will be stronger when there is a higher degree of organizational communication. In addition, organizational communication has signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on promotion of knowledge sharing, which is critical for organizational innovation (De Vries et al., 2006; Van den Hooff and De Ridder, 2004). Knowledge sharing often is accomplished through communication between individuals or departments within an organization and the importance of knowledge sharing can be spread through communication within the organization. Research regarding knowledge sharing in the context of higher education has shown that the members\u2019 minimal effort is revealed for knowledge transfer like innovative teaching practices (Dill, 1999) and passive forms of knowledge sharing is also shown such as using websites and databases (Treleaven et al., 2012). Nevertheless, if a university\u2019s openness to change is shared through organizational communication, then knowledge sharing would be increased. In turn, initiatives for sharing knowledge are important. An incongruence of openness to change between individuals and organization might bring different results than congruence when organizational communication is active. For example, when an organization\u2019s openness is higher than that of the organizational members, active communication across the organization would discourage member knowledge sharing by revealing the organization\u2019s force. In sum, the impact of the P-O \ufb01t for openness to change on knowledge sharing should be explored according to the level of organizational communication because communication can accelerate or disrupt knowledge sharing depending on the circumstance: H2. The positive effects of congruence of openness to change on knowledge sharing will be stronger when there is a higher degree of organizational communication. Figure 1 shows the research framework based on the literature review. In our research model, openness to change congruence (or incongruence) was an input variable, whereas learning organization and knowledge sharing were the outcomes. Organizational communication was a moderating factor in the research framework.", "length": 3381}
{"prompt": "Context In Korea, universities are in crisis because of a decrease in the school-age population and the Ministry of Education conducts diagnosis every three years. The government has implemented the University Basic Competency Assessment of Korea and provided \ufb01nancial support to universities based on the expected closures (Kim et al., 2020). Because reputation varies depending on the diagnosis results and is the standard for \ufb01nancial support, most universities are preparing for it and improving the basic competencies of universities in the process of improving the results. Private universities, which account for more than 85% of Korean universities, are subject to structural reform and are preparing for diagnosis through consulting. While conducting consulting at three private universities preparing for the diagnosis of basic university competency, we found that they were making tremendous efforts to seek organizational change and succeed like private companies. University organizations, which can be called knowledge-based organizations, can achieve organizational change based on learning organizations and knowledge sharing. Therefore, this study aims to examine the openness to change along with the two outcome variables (learning organization, knowledge sharing). As the drivers of change are external environment transformation and government evaluation, there was a view that the change initiative should be top-down. To change the university organization, it is necessary to understand the relationship between various interest groups. Dee and Leisyte (2017) conducted interviews with academics and students about seminar courses and advising centers for undergraduate students at universities. Quarchioni et al. (2020) systematized knowledge management in higher education institutions and presented a framework through thematic analysis. Despite the tightly coupled organizational characteristics, organizational change openness and willingness are different from each other, and this study examined the effect of individual and organizational differences and \ufb01ts on learning organization and knowledge sharing and highlighted the role of communication. Method Participants and procedures We targeted employees at three private universities for the current research. Each university included in the sample was rated as a \u201cself-improvement university\u201d or a \u201ccapacityenhancing university\u201d in the University Basic Competency Assessment of Korea, aiming for continued innovation and development. We used a four-point Likert scale for the data collection. All measurements were developed in English and back-translated into Korean by three bilingual subject-matter experts with doctorates in the areas of education administration, policy and career technical education. Some measurement scales were modi\ufb01ed to capture the structure of the university and to re\ufb02ect the higher education context. The survey was conducted as part of a university consulting project; faculty and administrative staff participated in the data collection process through an online survey platform. The faculty and staff are involved in a single task force team for consulting, so they are not treated separately. A survey was distributed to a total of 2,074 faculty and staff members from participating universities. A total of 1,085 participants responded, for a response rate of 52.31%. After excluding insincere responses and missing data, such as uniformly repeated responses (e.g. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and intentionally sequential responses (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), a total of 1,015 participants (faculty = 504, staff = 511) was included in the analysis. Of the participants, 49.7% were faculty and 50.3% were administrative staff members. Of the faculty, 24.4% were female and 47.6% had more than 10 years of organizational tenure. Measures Openness to change. Openness to change was measured using six items. From the original scale (Miller et al., 1994), three items were selected to measure individuals\u2019 perception of their openness to change. These three items were also modi\ufb01ed to measure how individuals perceive their organizations\u2019 openness to change. In terms of item reliability, both individual openness (a = 0.75) and organizational openness (a = 0.81) were internally reliable. Organizational communication. To assess organizational communication, we measured the level of communication through individuals\u2019 perceptions of their organization (i.e. an entire organization, university headquarters or department). For the measurements, we restructured and translated the scale to \ufb01t the university context based on the communication satisfaction questionnaire (Downs and Hazen, 1977). Finally, the measure comprised six items (a = 0.87) and was reliable. Learning organization. Learning organization was assessed with the Dimension of the Learning Organization Questionnaire (Yang et al., 2004). Item reliability (a = 0.86) was reliable. Knowledge sharing. To measure individuals\u2019 knowledge sharing, three items (a = 0.75) were adopted from Mura et al. (2013) scale, which represents the extent to which faculty and staff members share their best practices and experiences. Analytical strategies We collected control variables that might in\ufb02uence individuals\u2019 perceptions of knowledge and learning. First, we controlled for age, employment status, university and tenure. However, the results were not changed by including or not the control variables with the values coded for these demographics as dummy variables. Therefore, following guidelines for super\ufb02uous inclusion of control variables (Carlson and Wu, 2012; Vogel et al., 2016), we performed the analysis in the \ufb01nal model without any of these control variables. We measured the levels of individual and organizational openness to change (OOC) for independent variables through individual perceptions. To analyze the concepts of \ufb01t, congruence and incongruence, a quadratic equation including the two independent variables of polynomial regression was calculated and included in the regression model. We performed a moderated polynomial regression analysis using Mplus 8.4 and analyzed the response surface for a three-dimensional graph using OriginPro 2016 (Edwards and Lambert, 2007). Polynomial regression has been suggested as an alternative to the different scores of dependent variables and can be used to study the \ufb01t, congruence and incongruence of various variables. Before calculations, we conducted mean-centering for the moderator and scale-centering for the two independent variables to avoid multicollinearity issues and to interpret accurately. Polynomial regression analysis includes high-order terms, which are the squared and interacted terms of the individual openness to change (IOC) and OOC in this research. An equation considering the control variables was derived based on the concept presented by Edwards and Parry (1993), as follows: Results Table 1 presents the descriptive analysis including means, standard deviations, zero-order correlations and reliabilities among the variables. Moderate and signi\ufb01cant correlations were found among the variables. Additionally, we performed a con\ufb01rmatory factor analysis and most goodness-of-\ufb01t indices for our measurement model met the criteria ( x 2 = 6,819.60, df = 190, TLI = 0.90; CFI = 0.92; RMSEA = 0.07). Because the variables were measured by a single rater without any time interval, we performed Harman\u2019s single-factor test. The explained total variance was 33.64%; therefore, common method bias was not found (Podsakoff et al., 2003). We conducted a path analysis for the polynomial equations, as shown in Table 2. Many existing studies have examined the moderating effect between independent and dependent variables in nonlinear relationships. In this study, the effect of the moderator on congruence and dependent variables was examined based on previous studies (Graham et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2016). H1 predicted that the positive effect on learning organization would be stronger when communication was high. In Step 2, the F-statistic (F = 92.38) was signi\ufb01cant, indicating that communication could have a signi\ufb01cant moderating effect on a learning organization\u2019s interaction with openness to change congruence. To test the characteristics of the surface along the line of congruence, the slope and curvature were obtained at both high and low levels for the moderator. Guided by Cohen et al. (2003), we considered one standard deviation above and below the meancentered communication and entered the data into equation (1). Table 3 shows the estimated values of the slope and the curvatures of the line of congruence and the line of incongruence for the dependent variables, including learning organization and knowledge sharing. Based on the estimated coef\ufb01cients, Figure 2 shows the response surface. At a low level of communication, the slope of the surface along the line of congruence had a signi\ufb01cant positive value not equal to 0 (a 1 = 0.20, 90% CI [0.07, 0.33]). The results indicate the presence of a directional effect, which means that employees perceived a higher level of learning organization when IOC and OOC were high (high IOC and high OOC) compared with at lower levels (low IOC and low OOC). The curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence was estimated to determine whether the \ufb01t effect existed; however, this case was not signi\ufb01cant because the con\ufb01dence interval included zero (a 4 = \u00c00.13, 90% CI [\u00c00.34, 0.10]). This result indicates that there was no curvilinear or \ufb01t effect of learning organization on the line of incongruence when the level of communication was low. At high levels of communication, the slope of the surface along the line of congruence was not signi\ufb01cant (a 1 = 0.16, 90% CI [\u00c00.08, 0.40]), indicating a pattern of results dissimilar to those at low levels of communication. In contrast, the curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence had a negative and signi\ufb01cant value (a 4 = \u00c00.57, 90% CI [\u00c00.87, \u00c00.26]), with an inverted U-shaped curvature along the line of incongruence. This result indicates that learning organization is higher when an individual\u2019s openness to change is aligned with their organization\u2019s openness to change. When communication is high, the mis\ufb01ts and any deviations from the line of congruence could decrease learning organization. In other words, level of learning organization can be expected to be high through the \ufb01t of IOC and OOC under high-communication conditions. The results of this speci\ufb01c pattern support H1. When communication was low, there was no curvilinear effect of openness to change on learning organizations. However, for the condition of high communication, a strong \ufb01t effect on learning organization was observed due to the congruence of the openness to change. H2 predicted that the positive effect on knowledge sharing would be stronger when communication was high. Based on the F-statistic (F = 25.70), communication played a signi\ufb01cant moderating role in the relationship between openness to change incongruence and knowledge sharing. The lower parts of Table 3 and Figure 2 concern knowledge sharing and illustrate the response surface of the results. At low levels of communication, the slope of the surface along the line of incongruence was not signi\ufb01cantly different from 0 (a 3 = 0.19, 90% CI [\u00c00.03, 0.41]), indicating that there was no directional effect between IOC and OOC on knowledge sharing. We can conclude that any mis\ufb01ts of openness, in which individual openness was greater than organizational openness, had no signi\ufb01cant difference on knowledge sharing compared with individuals who perceived that their organization\u2019s openness was greater than their own. The curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence was signi\ufb01cant and positive (a 4 = 0.36, 90% CI [0.11, 0.62]), suggesting that the line of incongruence curved upward (convex). The positive signi\ufb01cant curvature indicates that more knowledge sharing occurred when IOC and OOC showed larger deviation from each other. In other words, when faculty and staff perceived a greater mismatch between openness at the individual and organizational levels, they shared more knowledge in the condition of low communication. These results indicate that the difference in perception between individuals and organizations is a need-supply \ufb01t. If the IOC is higher than that of the organization, knowledge sharing by the individual is more likely. If the organization\u2019s openness to change is higher, knowledge sharing can occur by learning the best practice established at an organization level. In high communication, the slope of the surface along the line of incongruence was signi\ufb01cant and positive (a 3 = 0.60, 90% CI [0.30, 0.92]), indicating a strong directional effect. Faculty and staff whose individual openness was greater than their perception of organizational openness were more likely to share their knowledge compared with faculty and staff who had low levels of individual openness. Therefore, in situations where communication is active, individuals whose openness to change is lower than organizational openness could be poor at sharing knowledge. As communication becomes plentiful, the curvature of the surface along the line of incongruence became non-signi\ufb01cant (a 4 = \u00c00.08, 90% CI [\u00c00.41, 0.25], which indicates that the line of incongruence was no longer curved. The curvilinear effect might have been lost because the linear directional effect was strongly signi\ufb01cant. Thus, as shown in Figure 2, when communication was high, knowledge sharing decreased along the line of incongruence because IOC was lower than OOC. The positive effects of the mis\ufb01t of openness on knowledge sharing were reduced at a high level of communication. Thus, H2 was not supported.", "length": 3217}

{"prompt": "Summarize the following.\nTitle: \"(6) How To Write a Business Plan in 10 Simple Steps - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"Business plan template is searched approximately 163,000 times a month. I'm here to tell you to stop searching because in today's video, I'll be showing you how to make the ultimate business plan. Business plans are absolutely essential for any business. Why? Well, because a solid business plan will allow you to rigorously assess idea feasibility research and find insights on target markets, and assess your competition. These are all things that you need to do in order to make your business as successful as it can be. And when the time comes, investors will rely heavily on your business plan to evaluate the feasibility of your business before funding it. If you haven't already, make sure you're subscribed to the channel as we release new videos every week that will help you build your business. Oh, and stay tuned to the end of this video when I share a little gift from me to you. Let's get into it. The first part of every business plan is the executive summary, the executive summarys purpose is to distill everything in the business plan into a single page, and give a high level overview of your business. This is like the Canadian tuxedo, almost like a blazer over a flannel shirt. Admittedly, that one page constraint can make it seem like squeezing in a lot of information will be impossible, but trust me, it's not. What I like to do is break down each section of the business plan into one or two sentences to ensure that everything is succinct and easy to read. Here's what your business plans executive summary should include: your business concept, business goals and vision, product differentiation and description, your target market, your marketing plan, your current financial state, projected financial, state, the ask. So if you're asking for money, how much are you asking for and your team. For more ideas on how to identify your target market, be sure to check out our last video on how to build a brand in the right hand corner right up here. Now let's move on to a biggie, your company overview. This section of your business plan should include two fundamental questions. Who are you and what do you plan to do? Answering these questions provides an introduction to why you're in business, why you're different, what you have going for you, and why you'd be a good investment. To answer these questions, you'll want to include these components in your overview: your business structure. For example, is your business a sole proprietorship? A general partnership? A limited partnership, or is it an incorporated company? This can often be visualized using an organizational chart. You also want to share the nature of your business. What are you selling? Now specify the industry. Are you in fashion? Electronics? What is your landscape currently look like and where could it be heading? You're going to also want to list your team, including key personnel and their salaries. If I was doing this right now, it would just be me. But I would also want to include future plans for scaling up my company. So I can see here that you've got four years of working experience as a good boy? Can you start on Monday? Or I could just leave it as me. You can also use this section to highlight background information on your business or its history. Get creative and be authentic in this part. This is where you can really draw people in and have them invest in how it all started for you. So I thought it might be good to provide an example here. So Sit With Me, the dog rescue that I volunteer for and run the store for, has been operating since 2012 and since then we've gone on to help over 1200 dogs. We do not discriminate based off of breed, medical history or age, so every dog has a chance to find their forever home through our rescue. And that was very important from the get go. And we also do not have anyone that's making a salary, so it's entirely volunteer based. Um, it's all by the good graces of our community and everyone that's out there willing to put in money, time, and effort to help these dogs. A big component of your company overview will be outlining your business's vision, mission and values. I'm going to do a deep dive into this one with you. To define your values. Start thinking about all the people that your company is accountable to, including owners, employees, suppliers, customers, and investors. Now, I want you to consider how you'd like to conduct business with each of them. As you make a list, your core values should start to emerge. For example, Ikea lists some of its values as humbleness and willpower. Leadership by example, and daring to be different. Now, the mission statement. Your statement should explain in a convincing manner and ideally a single sentence why your business exists. For example, Shopify's mission statement is \"make commerce better for everyone\". It's the why behind everything we do and it's crystal clear and needs no further explanation. Next, craft your vision statement. What impact do you envision your business having on the world when you've achieved your vision? Make sure you phrase that impact using assertive language. For example, Nike's vision statement is bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. If you have a body, you are an athlete. Finally, include your business objectives, both short and longterm. I like to keep my goals on track by ensuring that they are smart. Meaning specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time bound. Now get ready to do some serious work as the next part of this plan, we'll be diving into market research. For the marketing analysis section, you want to be including an overview of your potential market, an analysis of your business's position within that market, and an overview of the competitive landscape. I'm not exaggerating when I say that your market can make or break your business. If you choose the right market with the right products, one with plenty of customers who understand and need your product, you'll most likely have a headstart on success. When diving into potential markets, you will need to be looking into as much relevant independent data as possible to validate your business. This can be a huge task, but I find that breaking it down into two starting points, it then becomes much more manageable. First, I seek to identify my ideal customer profile. A customer profile should be a detailed factual description of your target audience. For example, if you're targeting millennial customers in the U S I would first start by looking at government data about the size of that group. Secondly, I researched relevant industry trends and trajectories. I like to approach this section by going to Google Trends and using keywords as a jumping off point and then diving into more granular data. For example, say that I wanted to start a Halloween mask business and I wanted to know the trends of that industry. I would go to Google Trends, type in Halloween masks, and then get granular on the results page. Looking at things like where this industry has peaked outside of seasonal time. I would then dive into what made it peak and have a look at some of the search terms and show shifts and changes in the popularity of the industry. From here, I would then dive into sources such as government statistics offices, industry associations, academic research and respected news outlets covering the industry to get a robust view and understanding of landscape. Now, when assessing my business's position in the market, I like to use a SWOT analysis to break things down. Using a grid format. You want to start listing out the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to your business. I like using SWOT because you can clearly see the positive and negative internal and external factors that may impact your business visually. Now, the competitor analysis. For this analysis, I like to include a list of a few companies that I would consider direct competitors, and then I state how I plan to differentiate my product and business from theirs. Okay. Now we're into the products and services section. You want to provide more detailed information here on your products and state why your product stands out in the market. Like before, we want things to be succinct and visual. Patents, copyrights, and trademarks that you own or have applied for should also be listed in this section. In the customer segmentation section, you want to give a holistic overview of your ideal customer. A lot of this information should be clear to you after you've done preliminary research on your target market. When talking about your customers in this section, you want to include a number of general and specific demographic characteristics: such as where they live, their age range, their level of education, how much they earn, their values, beliefs or opinions. Ideally, you should be specific enough that it's very clear who you're trying to reach with your business, and even more importantly, why you've made the choices you have based on who your customers are and what they value. Now we should be ready to move on to highlighting your marketing plan. Your plan here should outline your current and future strategies for marketing your product to your ideal customers. For example, say that I have a phone case company and I know that a lot of my audience is on TikTok, I will show that I plan to leverage that knowledge into creating a paid campaign on that platform using content specifically created for my key customers. I will then also include how I plan to measure the success of that campaign. Now, although sometimes marketing is seen as purely promotional, your plan should include information on the following, four key subjects: price, so how much does your product cost? Product, what are you selling, and how do you plan to differentiate yourself in the market? Place. Where will you sell your products? And finally promotion. How will you get your products in front of your ideal customer. By including these, you're showing investors and yourself that you have thought about every facet of how your marketing strategy will be effective in driving customers to your business. Now onto our logistics and operations plan. You really want to cover all parts of your business operation in this section. Including where you get the raw materials you need for production or where your products are produced. Highlighting if you'll make, manufacturer, wholesale, or dropship your product. Then stating how long it takes to produce your products and get them shipped. You'll also want to touch on how you might handle a busy season or an unexpected spike in demand discussing facilities. For example. Where will you and your team members work? Do you have plans to have a physical retail space? If so, where? Outlining the tools and technology that you require in order to be up and running. This includes everything from computers to light bulbs to everything in between. Finally, discuss the specifics on how you're handling inventory. For example, how much will you keep on hand and where will it be stored? How will you ship it to partners if required, and how will you keep track of incoming and outgoing inventory? This section should demonstrate that you've got a solid understanding of your supply chain and a strong contingency plan in case of any potential uncertainty. Finally, we're going to end with the financial plan. Now I know what you're thinking, boring, but I assure you this will be an important step in your business plan. The level of detail required in your financial plan will really depend on your audience and goals. However, typically you want to include three major views of your financials. An income statement, a balance sheet and a cashflow statement. Your income statement is designed to give your readers a look into your revenue sources and expenses over a given period of time. Your balance sheet should offer a look at how much equity you have in your business. On one side, you'll list all of your businesses assets, so what you own and on the other side, all of your liabilities. So what you owe. This will provide a snapshot of your business's shareholder equity, which is calculated as. Assets minus liabilities equals equity. Now, your cashflow statement is similar to your income statement with one important difference. It takes into account when revenues are collected and when expenses are paid. It can be especially helpful to forecast your cashflow statement to identify gaps or negative cashflow and adjust operations as required. If you're worried right now about how to best format this out, because numbers and math are not really your thing. Don't be put off by this section. Shopify has created a set of formatted sheets specifically for helping you formulate this section of your business plan. By taking the time to develop your business plan, you're actually achieving a number of extremely beneficial things for your business. A business plan will allow you to evaluate your business idea. For your business to be successful, it needs to be tangible. This plan will help solidify that. It will also help you plan for the next phase of your business and help you think about scaling and scope. It will then empower you to start thinking about hiring additional staff or even building partnerships. Additionally, it will clarify strategies, goals, and tactics and make them actionable. Finally, it will help you if you're looking to secure funds for your business, whether it be from a bank or an investor. As promised, I did say that I would have a little gift for you and that is my ultimate business template. You're welcome and Hey, if you did use our template to create your own business plan, let us know what learnings you had from doing that. Did you find a new customer base or a cool new market to tap into? Let us know. Let us know. Oh, okay. Lettuce, lettuce know. If had a piece of lettuce. That'd be fantastic.\"", "length": 3116}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n Stress and Back Pain\n From Chris\nThe day I sat down to edit this chapter for the last time, there was an obituary in the New York Times for John E. Sarno, MD, who \u201cwrote the book\u201d (Healing and Back Pain) on what he claimed (without support, I\u2019m afraid) were the psychological origins of back pain. As the Times put it, he was \u201crevered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack.\u201d That is still roughly the state of his reputation today: Doctors tend to dismiss him but a lot of his patients think he\u2019s terrific. Jeremy takes a middle ground. He thinks that perhaps 10 percent of back pain has primarily emotional roots and the rest is physical. In addition, psychological elements can aggravate physical pain significantly. But 10 percent is worth a word here. More than a word, actually. Jeremy and I do not presume to give psychiatric advice\u2014or advice about stress, which is mostly what\u2019s involved\u2014but we include this brief chapter just to alert you to the possibility that your back pain may have its roots in stress or it may be worsened by stress or other largely psychological issues. \nI confess that a couple of years ago I would have been even more skeptical than I am today about stress and, by extension, about the connection between stress and back pain. But there has been a lot of talk lately about stress being the great scourge of American life, especially corporate life, and the importance of \u201cmindfulness\u201d; there seems to be broad agreement that both are real and important. Some corporations are spending serious time trying to help their people learn mindfulness. Like others of my generation, I used to think that talk about stress (I\u2019d never heard of mindfulness) was something made up in California by out-of-work yoga teachers, and I said the hell with it. That, it turns out, was a deeply uninformed view. Stress, I have lately learned, is very real indeed. And it probably can raise hell with your back, all by itself. Jeremy\u2019s estimate that some 10 percent of back pain is caused by stress is probably pretty good. \nStress is a fundamental part of our emotional wiring, and it runs deep. I\u2019m going to use a little technical language here to make me sound smarter than I am. A lot of the emotional stress we face is handled by our \u201cautonomic nervous system.\u201d How do you like that! Two branches of the autonomic nervous system have a lot to do with running emotions and related body changes. The first is the sympathetic branch, which basically speeds things up when life gets hairy. The other one is the parasympathetic branch, which basically slows things down, especially after a fight-or-flight event has made you crazy. \nThe parasympathetic system is for everyday use, when things are more or less okay. It handles routine stress in a routine way, and does not make you sick or crazy. The sympathetic system is supposed to be triggered only when things get seriously scary (we are talking about the sudden appearance of lions, say, or robbers with guns)\u2014extreme situations in which it makes sense to go crazy. If there really is a lion looming in the deep grass, you\u2019ve got to get out of there ASAP, so all the stress you can muster makes perfect sense. Same deal on the streets of the city when a thief with a knife appears out of the shadows and asks if you would be good enough to give him your wallet. Or your wife. Again, legitimate stress. \nYour body does an amazing thing in those fight-or-flight situations. Everything is instantly rewired to give you the best shot at either fighting back or getting away. One big change is in the blood\u2014of which there is not enough to be everywhere at once. It is shifted from peacetime distribution to a wartime footing. It is drained out of your digestive system, for example, and redirected to your extremities: legs to run for your life, or arms and shoulders and hands to grapple with the beast. And it goes to the parts of your brain and nervous system that deal with emergencies. At the same time, your heart cranks up to deliver four or five times as much blood to your body. The hair on your body \u201cstands up\u201d so it is better able to sense movement in the air (wow!). Your eyes dilate and your hearing becomes more acute. The nutrient absorption system is shut down, as are many other systems that have to do with routine maintenance. (Chronic, nonstop stress, which we\u2019ll get to in a minute, is a horror for a couple of reasons. First, you cannot be responding to those extreme conditions all the time: That would be like a muscle spasm\u2014it starts to hurt. Second, all those routine but deeply important processes get shortchanged, and you go to hell for lack of maintenance. So . . . chronic stress is super-bad.)\nWhen the threat passes (and if you survive), the parasympathetic system takes over and order is restored. The hair on your neck settles down, the regular allocation of blood returns, and so on. And it works like a charm for zebras and elands and such. For us, alas, not so good. As Robert M. Sapolsky tells us in Why Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers, the zebra can be running furiously for its life one minute, and calmly cropping grass the next. Zebras are blessed with forgetfulness. Not us. We are blessed\u2014and cursed\u2014with the ability to contemplate and prepare for future emergencies and to hold on to and learn from past ones. We are not designed to let go. Eventually we do let go, but it takes us longer. So we have more stress than zebras. \nWe have another flaw in the way our fight-or-flight mechanism works. It is not just the lion or the guy with the knife that sets off our system; it\u2019s all kinds of stuff. Like competition in the workplace. Like fear of our boss. Like rejection or demotion for failure to achieve this or that. Which may not sound bad but it really is. Because we take that kind of stress just as seriously as we do the lion-in-the-grass type of stress. And the problem is that that kind of stress is being triggered almost constantly, in our aptly named \u201chigh stress\u201d workplaces and society. Which leads to chronic stress. \nIntermittent stress\u2014the kind that is triggered when the lion jumps out at you\u2014is useful. Chronic stress is a curse. Not a complete curse; it does enable \u201cadvanced\u201d cultures like ours to focus much harder and much, much longer than humans used to do on what we want to achieve. We run our mighty engines at near-redline levels all the time and, sure enough, we tear around like crazy . . . achieving great things. Which is nice. And we pat ourselves on the back for doing it. (And view the French, say, with contempt because they are not as nutty as we are.) We more than pat ourselves on the back; we give each other fat salaries and tremendous recognition. Being able to function at \u201credline\u201d or sympathetic nervous system levels almost all the time is richly rewarded in this country. Which is fine except for one thing: It is eating us alive. The dislocation of circulation from core to extremities, the hyper-use of the signaling system, all the profound changes that are set in motion when the lion looms short change other areas, including, interestingly enough, our lower backs. And that dislocation can cause random short circuits, muscle spasms, and weird torques to the back. And they hurt. Quite a lot. It is not the principal source of back pain, but, for those who suffer from it, it is deadly serious and is entitled to serious treatment.\nHow do you know if you are part of the minority for whom stress is a serious cause of back pain? Hard to say but basically it\u2019s just like what Jeremy says about back pain generally: Pay attention to the pain. Focus on the behaviors that seem to precede or go with back pain. And cut them out. If back pain is correlated with stressful situations, think about it. Maybe get yourself out of that mess. Or study one of the thousands of books about \u201cstress management\u201d and \u201cmindfulness.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of material out there on mindfulness, and it is helpful. \nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy, Anyone?\nOkay, here\u2019s my own little stress story, the one that made me seriously open to the idea of stress as a serious thing. \nI was recently in the midst of a ton of heavy, work-related stuff, and we had just flown out to Aspen for a series of work meetings and such (there would be a little skiing but not much). We were starting two new businesses and neither was easy. Hilary and I got to the friend\u2019s house where we were staying late at night. But the real thing was that I had learned earlier that day that my beloved coauthor and friend, Harry Lodge, was going to die of cancer in the next few days. The whole business was the very definition of stress\u2014a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d you could say. \nThe morning after our late-night arrival, I was unpacking when I had a \u201cfunny feeling\u201d in my chest. Long story short, I told Hilary I felt weird, we called the local hospital, and soon I was on a gurney in a big ambulance being rushed to the emergency room. I was met by an absolutely terrific heart doc, a mild-mannered guy with a serious national reputation, even though he mostly practiced in a medium-size Colorado town. Lucky me. He said I was having a heart attack, and he was going to run a camera up my femoral artery (in my leg) to take some movies of my heart and put in stents to open the presumably clogged arteries . . . all the stuff I needed to, you know, stay alive. \nRats! I have always been proud as a peacock of my great heart and aerobic strength; now this! Good grief. \nBut it turns out it was not that bad. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says, after I come out of the anesthesia. \u201cYou don\u2019t see this every day, but you did not have a heart attack. A heart attack is a failure of the heart, caused by a blockage of blood vessels that feed the heart. In a surprisingly short time, the part of the heart that is not getting fed\u2014or the whole organ\u2014dies. That is a heart attack and, mercifully, you did not have that. In fact, your heart and the vessels that feed it are in amazing shape: You will never have a heart attack.\u201d Oh. I took that pretty well, but I was curious, too. If I\u2019m not having a heart attack, why are we here? \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the doc says again. \u201cI have only seen it a few times, but you have a classic case of stress-induced cardiomyopathy . . . a temporary (and sometimes fatal) weakness of the heart itself, caused by stress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cExtremely lucky man. You have what is sometimes called \u2018the widow\u2019s broken heart,\u2019 common among recently bereaved spouses. Almost certainly brought on, in your case, by general stress and by concern for your gravely ill friend. [He had interviewed me briefly before the procedure.] Sometimes it is fatal, but not for you. And, if it\u2019s not fatal, it simply goes away.\u201d I nod, but I don\u2019t begin to get it. I press for more information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the videotape,\u201d he says. He wheels over this big gadget and, in a second, I am looking at a movie of my own beating heart. Yowee! A very rare treat. None of the many tests for heart problems goes inside and takes movies; it\u2019s too dangerous. But this was not a test, and here we are. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d he says, and points to what he says are the amazingly clear (unblocked) and peppy arteries all around my heart. And the strength of the muscles. Rare, he says, especially for an old chap like me. Then he drops the bomb. \n\u201cHere is where the stress hit you,\u201d he says, and points to the lower one-eighth of my thumping heart. \u201cYour other heart walls are vigorous and fine, pumping lots of blood. This area, they are not. Also, you have some fibrillation, irregular beats.\u201d He points. The difference is unmistakable. For a long time we both stare at my beating heart, see the weakness and the arrhythmia. \u201cThis will go away on its own in a while,\u201d he says. And repeats how very lucky I am. Huh.\nWhat\u2019s the point of the story? It\u2019s simple: Stress is real. You can see it in a movie of your heart. It can have a very real impact on your body. It literally weakens you and leaves you prone to all kinds of things. You can see stress happening on some occasions. And\u2014maybe\u2014there are things you can do about it. I received several serious lectures from doctors during my \u201cwidow\u2019s heart attack\u201d phase, all urging me to remember that I was in my eighties and to, for heaven\u2019s sake, cut back some on my routine. Which I did. It\u2019s an interesting compromise between staying as alive and fully committed as possible. I\u2019m still feeling my way. We\u2019ll see. \nWhat about you? All we can say is, watch yourself. By which we mean, keep an eye on your own situation and bear in mind the possibility that your back pain may be stress related. Then our advice is to quit your job, get a bowl of rice, and sit on the sidewalk. Or go live with your parents. Some damn thing, I don\u2019t know. Stress is hard. But it is not imaginary. Read up on it. Do something. \nActually, we have some better advice than that. There are a lot of well-trained people\u2014including our friend Sarah Stuart, who has done retreats and other work with me\u2014who have studied stress and who instruct businesspeople in particular in \u201cmindfulness,\u201d a technique that the great guru in the field, Jon Kabat Zinn, defines as \u201cpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\u201d Okay. But my shallow experience with it would lead me to say it is learning to do relatively short bursts when you clear your mind of all thoughts about what\u2019s coming next (or what stupid thing", "length": 3416}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n RULE #6\n Crawl Before You Walk, Walk Before You Run\n From Jeremy\nAs you know by now, the essence of the protocol is lifelong behavioral change. That means changing the way you carry yourself and move (the neutral spine and all that). But it also means adopting and staying with our carefully designed (and progressive) exercise regimen. It is designed for back pain and it is essential for a permanent cure. And you have to do it correctly. There is an awful lot of text and a bunch of pictures about exercise in this book. But it\u2019s not because you have to do so many exercises; there really aren\u2019t that many. It\u2019s because we want you to do them right. Remember, you are far more likely to do these exercises with the compensatory patterns you have been doing for years unless you read closely and concentrate on doing them the right way. Doing them the wrong way will just make you better at doing bad things. \nOne great key to doing them right is to go slow in the learning process. Whether you\u2019re the type or not, you have to take it step-by-step. This is a healing process, and you cannot rush a healing process; it has its own rhythm and you have to follow it. Roll out these exercises slowly over time, progressing from one level to the next only when you \u201cget\u201d the level you are on and are ready to move up. \nRemember, it is these daily exercises that\u2014more than anything else\u2014are going to give most of you a significant and permanent reduction in pain and tightness. Other steps get you past the immediate pain. These steps make the change permanent. \nBe Still to Heal; Be Still to Stay Well \nOne of the main goals of changing your movement patterns is to make the \u201cbe still to heal\u201d concept (Rule #2, in Chapter 7) part of your daily life. Once you have achieved an initial fix, you don\u2019t have to be as still. But it is a great idea to learn to move with relative stillness (without moving your lumbar spine too much) all the time. \nThis is a big change for most of you, and you have to take it in steps; as I say, you have to crawl before you walk. The first step in learning to keep your lumbar spine still routinely is simply to learn to march in place, with a neutral spine. (This is the \u201ccrawl\u201d part of the process; it may seem too easy to bother with. It is not.) The goal is to learn to march in place with no lower spine movement. Then you can move on to other movements in this chapter.\nKey tip: If any of these movements hurt, take a step back to the last thing you could do without pain (marching in place, for instance). Stay with that for a few more days and then try to progress again. In theory, if you can march in place without pain, you can walk without pain and move without pain. It\u2019s just a matter of building up your core, turning on the right muscles, and learning to use those muscles to move in the right way. Whenever you have difficulty, go back to the previous step and start again. \nOkay, you\u2019ve done marching in place without moving your lower spine. Once that feels relatively simple, try doing this while walking. Things become a little murkier here because there are many factors at play. Because you are now weight-bearing, you need the support of important muscle groups like the glutes and latissimus dorsi (lats) to support your spine, in addition to the muscles we talked about in the core. If you can\u2019t do this at first without pain, follow the advice in the book for a while, and it will come once you have developed enough strength to support your spine while standing. \nWalking with Neutral Spine \nLearning to walk with a neutral spine means applying the same mechanics of your Slow March with Neutral Spine exercise to an upright, weight-bearing position. Almost everyone can improve their ability to walk without pain if they can do the slow march exercise on the ground. The distance you can walk without pain, or without significant increases in pain, will increase as you build core and gluteal strength and endurance by doing the exercises in this book. To get started on increasing your ability to walk with decreased pain, follow these directions:\nStep 1: Stand with good posture. Stand tall, shoulders back, head over your shoulders. Think of sticking your chest out and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaning forward. Tilt your pelvis back and forth (just like you did on the floor earlier), and stop where your lower back feels the most comfortable. \nStep 2: Use your core to lock your neutral spine in place. \nStep 3: Now try to walk while maintaining the position of your lower back and with the good posture you just set. It can help to put one hand on your stomach and one on your low back to feel for movement. Once you feel like you\u2019ve mastered maintaining neutral spine while walking, start to swing your arms from the shoulders, arm to opposite leg. This means if your right leg is swinging forward, your left arm should be as well. Make sure to always swing your arms from the shoulders as you walk; this helps dissipate force away from the spine. This movement takes time to master so don\u2019t get frustrated. Keep practicing. It gets easier after you have built endurance and strength in the muscles that support the spine. \nStep 4: If you sense your back is about to hurt, stop and have a seat for a few minutes and give your back a break. Then try walking a little longer. Over time, the period between these sitting breaks should increase, allowing you to walk farther without pain.\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complex movements. To make it easier (and to improve your chances of success) we are going to break those more complex movements down into pieces and then put them all together at the end. We will start with movement from the hips, a very basic move in all our lives all the time. Let\u2019s start with hip-hinging. Hip-hinging is a way to bend forward without stressing (i.e., bending) the spine. Done right, the axis of movement is in the hips, not the low back. Your low back should be in a protected neutral position with the core engaged. As you bend forward, your low back doesn\u2019t round or move. Let\u2019s look at a picture of hip-hinging and a picture of lumbar flexion (low back bending); one is good, the other is bad. This is simple stuff, but it is very hard to get over your ancient, bad habits. Hard but essential. \n\nHip-Hinge with Neutral Spine\nHere are a couple of pictures showing you the right way to hinge (on the left) and the wrong way (on the right). Notice the very slightly curved lower back in the hip-hinge picture on the left: no movement. Excellent! The pic on the right has quite a lot of spine movement; don\u2019t do that. When you first try this movement, it may feel awkward, and you may assume that you cannot reach as far forward with good posture. Not so. You\u2019ll soon realize that you can move just as far forward, using only your hips, as you did before, using your back. You don\u2019t lose anything and you avoid a ton of pain. Over time you will gain mobility. The reason is that moving with your lower back eventually causes pain and stiffness in your back. But moving from your hips will not have that result. Let\u2019s practice doing it right. \nRight Wrong\n\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Feel the two bones sticking out of the sides of your hips. These are called your greater trochanters. Picture a pole going through these two points, passing right through your pelvis. This is your imaginary axis of movement.\nStep 5: Now place one hand on your stomach and the other on your back. On your back, put your fingers on those little bones sticking out (spinous processes). You are putting your hands here to feel for any unwanted movement when you hip-hinge. \nStep 6: Without moving anything in the core (you shouldn\u2019t feel those little bones in your back moving), slowly bend forward on that imaginary axis of movement through the hip bones while sticking your buttocks out behind you a little bit. If you feel your stomach or back move, stop, reset, and try again.\n\nStep 7: Go only as far forward as you can without moving your back. For many of you, your hamstrings (back of legs) are going to be a limiting factor in your range of motion in the beginning. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t go too far. Your hamstrings will loosen up in time if you follow all of the advice in this book. \nStep 8: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your back or stomach. \nStep 9: This should not hurt your low back. If it does, reset your stance, find neutral spine, brace your core. Not hurting? Now try it again with a very small range of motion. Stay within the range of motion that doesn\u2019t hurt. Slowly increase your range of motion over time\u2014it will come. \nAdding Rotation\nNow let\u2019s get a little more complex. Let\u2019s add rotation to the bend. Hip-hinging correctly allows you to move forward and backward without pain. Now let\u2019s learn to move side to side. We are talking rotation. Again, think about moving from the hips. It\u2019s easiest to visualize proper rotation if you think about your waist. We don\u2019t want any movement at the waist. Try to picture your rib cage being locked on to your pelvis. That\u2019s what you want. Pretend that there are no joints between your ribs and pelvis, for this one. \nFull-Body Rotation\nThe chest, navel, and hips all move together. This means there is no (or very little) movement in the spine. The body rotates by moving the hips, knees, and pelvis. If the hips and pelvis stay facing forward while the rib cage moves, the movement comes from the waist, and therefore the lumbar spine. This type of movement can wear down the discs and joints in the spine over time, especially when additional load is applied (like unloading the dishwasher for instance). Just like hip-hinging, rotation done properly doesn\u2019t cause you to lose mobility and will improve athletic performance. Let\u2019s give it a try. Once again, the new movement is not that hard. But you are trying to unlearn a lifetime of moving with your spine. That is hard. \n\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Place your hands on the top of your pelvis with your fingers pointed forward. This hand position is to help you visualize movement of the pelvis as you get used to this movement. \nStep 5: Keep the knees bent and loose but the core engaged, and try to turn a little to the right by shifting the knees and hips. Your fingers, navel, hip bones, chest bone, and face should all point the same direction. It\u2019s okay if you pivot the feet a little bit. \n\nStep 6: Now try to the left.\nStep 7: Slowly increase your range of motion by bending more at the knees. \nStep 8: Then increase your range of motion even more by pivoting your feet. \nStep 9: At all times and especially at the end of the movement, your chest bone, head, navel, and hips should be in alignment. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\nKnee pain: Stay lighter on your feet\\ and pivot the ball of the inside foot (the side you are moving away from) as you rotate. \nTorso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat\nNow let\u2019s try to put those two movements\u2014the hip-hinge and the rotation\u2014together with a squat for a realistic, three-dimensional movement that allows you to accomplish everyday tasks (think unloading the dishwasher, putting up groceries) without stressing your back. You are going to rotate and bend down (hip-hinge), then come back up to the other side and extend. \nNotice that within that entire chain of movement, the person in the drawing does not really move his spine (look at the waist if you\u2019re having trouble visualizing that). The rib cage remains locked onto the pelvis the entire time. These pictures show you that you can go almost 180 degrees from side to side, stooping as low as you can and then extending as high as your hands can go, without compromising your back. Let\u2019s try it.\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in. \nStep 3: Stand with good posture. \nStep 4: Rotate torso to the right without twisting the waist as before.", "length": 3133}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER NINETEEN\n Congratulations! And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing. Even though we don\u2019t have room to show you the things you should do instead, we wanted to give you a sharp warning about the things you should not do. We include these \u201cbad exercises\u201d here so you don\u2019t hurt yourself.\nBEHIND THE HEAD LAT PULLDOWNS \nLat pull down alternative", "length": 3251}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n RULE #6\n Crawl Before You Walk, Walk Before You Run\n From Jeremy\nAs you know by now, the essence of the protocol is lifelong behavioral change. That means changing the way you carry yourself and move (the neutral spine and all that). But it also means adopting and staying with our carefully designed (and progressive) exercise regimen. It is designed for back pain and it is essential for a permanent cure. And you have to do it correctly. There is an awful lot of text and a bunch of pictures about exercise in this book. But it\u2019s not because you have to do so many exercises; there really aren\u2019t that many. It\u2019s because we want you to do them right. Remember, you are far more likely to do these exercises with the compensatory patterns you have been doing for years unless you read closely and concentrate on doing them the right way. Doing them the wrong way will just make you better at doing bad things. \nOne great key to doing them right is to go slow in the learning process. Whether you\u2019re the type or not, you have to take it step-by-step. This is a healing process, and you cannot rush a healing process; it has its own rhythm and you have to follow it. Roll out these exercises slowly over time, progressing from one level to the next only when you \u201cget\u201d the level you are on and are ready to move up. \nRemember, it is these daily exercises that\u2014more than anything else\u2014are going to give most of you a significant and permanent reduction in pain and tightness. Other steps get you past the immediate pain. These steps make the change permanent. \nBe Still to Heal; Be Still to Stay Well \nOne of the main goals of changing your movement patterns is to make the \u201cbe still to heal\u201d concept (Rule #2, in Chapter 7) part of your daily life. Once you have achieved an initial fix, you don\u2019t have to be as still. But it is a great idea to learn to move with relative stillness (without moving your lumbar spine too much) all the time. \nThis is a big change for most of you, and you have to take it in steps; as I say, you have to crawl before you walk. The first step in learning to keep your lumbar spine still routinely is simply to learn to march in place, with a neutral spine. (This is the \u201ccrawl\u201d part of the process; it may seem too easy to bother with. It is not.) The goal is to learn to march in place with no lower spine movement. Then you can move on to other movements in this chapter.\nKey tip: If any of these movements hurt, take a step back to the last thing you could do without pain (marching in place, for instance). Stay with that for a few more days and then try to progress again. In theory, if you can march in place without pain, you can walk without pain and move without pain. It\u2019s just a matter of building up your core, turning on the right muscles, and learning to use those muscles to move in the right way. Whenever you have difficulty, go back to the previous step and start again. \nOkay, you\u2019ve done marching in place without moving your lower spine. Once that feels relatively simple, try doing this while walking. Things become a little murkier here because there are many factors at play. Because you are now weight-bearing, you need the support of important muscle groups like the glutes and latissimus dorsi (lats) to support your spine, in addition to the muscles we talked about in the core. If you can\u2019t do this at first without pain, follow the advice in the book for a while, and it will come once you have developed enough strength to support your spine while standing. \nWalking with Neutral Spine \nLearning to walk with a neutral spine means applying the same mechanics of your Slow March with Neutral Spine exercise to an upright, weight-bearing position. Almost everyone can improve their ability to walk without pain if they can do the slow march exercise on the ground. The distance you can walk without pain, or without significant increases in pain, will increase as you build core and gluteal strength and endurance by doing the exercises in this book. To get started on increasing your ability to walk with decreased pain, follow these directions:\nStep 1: Stand with good posture. Stand tall, shoulders back, head over your shoulders. Think of sticking your chest out and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Make sure you aren\u2019t leaning forward. Tilt your pelvis back and forth (just like you did on the floor earlier), and stop where your lower back feels the most comfortable. \nStep 2: Use your core to lock your neutral spine in place. \nStep 3: Now try to walk while maintaining the position of your lower back and with the good posture you just set. It can help to put one hand on your stomach and one on your low back to feel for movement. Once you feel like you\u2019ve mastered maintaining neutral spine while walking, start to swing your arms from the shoulders, arm to opposite leg. This means if your right leg is swinging forward, your left arm should be as well. Make sure to always swing your arms from the shoulders as you walk; this helps dissipate force away from the spine. This movement takes time to master so don\u2019t get frustrated. Keep practicing. It gets easier after you have built endurance and strength in the muscles that support the spine. \nStep 4: If you sense your back is about to hurt, stop and have a seat for a few minutes and give your back a break. Then try walking a little longer. Over time, the period between these sitting breaks should increase, allowing you to walk farther without pain.\nNow let\u2019s move on to more complex movements. To make it easier (and to improve your chances of success) we are going to break those more complex movements down into pieces and then put them all together at the end. We will start with movement from the hips, a very basic move in all our lives all the time. Let\u2019s start with hip-hinging. Hip-hinging is a way to bend forward without stressing (i.e., bending) the spine. Done right, the axis of movement is in the hips, not the low back. Your low back should be in a protected neutral position with the core engaged. As you bend forward, your low back doesn\u2019t round or move. Let\u2019s look at a picture of hip-hinging and a picture of lumbar flexion (low back bending); one is good, the other is bad. This is simple stuff, but it is very hard to get over your ancient, bad habits. Hard but essential. \n\nHip-Hinge with Neutral Spine\nHere are a couple of pictures showing you the right way to hinge (on the left) and the wrong way (on the right). Notice the very slightly curved lower back in the hip-hinge picture on the left: no movement. Excellent! The pic on the right has quite a lot of spine movement; don\u2019t do that. When you first try this movement, it may feel awkward, and you may assume that you cannot reach as far forward with good posture. Not so. You\u2019ll soon realize that you can move just as far forward, using only your hips, as you did before, using your back. You don\u2019t lose anything and you avoid a ton of pain. Over time you will gain mobility. The reason is that moving with your lower back eventually causes pain and stiffness in your back. But moving from your hips will not have that result. Let\u2019s practice doing it right. \nRight Wrong\n\nStep 1: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Feel the two bones sticking out of the sides of your hips. These are called your greater trochanters. Picture a pole going through these two points, passing right through your pelvis. This is your imaginary axis of movement.\nStep 5: Now place one hand on your stomach and the other on your back. On your back, put your fingers on those little bones sticking out (spinous processes). You are putting your hands here to feel for any unwanted movement when you hip-hinge. \nStep 6: Without moving anything in the core (you shouldn\u2019t feel those little bones in your back moving), slowly bend forward on that imaginary axis of movement through the hip bones while sticking your buttocks out behind you a little bit. If you feel your stomach or back move, stop, reset, and try again.\n\nStep 7: Go only as far forward as you can without moving your back. For many of you, your hamstrings (back of legs) are going to be a limiting factor in your range of motion in the beginning. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t go too far. Your hamstrings will loosen up in time if you follow all of the advice in this book. \nStep 8: Slowly return to the starting position without moving your back or stomach. \nStep 9: This should not hurt your low back. If it does, reset your stance, find neutral spine, brace your core. Not hurting? Now try it again with a very small range of motion. Stay within the range of motion that doesn\u2019t hurt. Slowly increase your range of motion over time\u2014it will come. \nAdding Rotation\nNow let\u2019s get a little more complex. Let\u2019s add rotation to the bend. Hip-hinging correctly allows you to move forward and backward without pain. Now let\u2019s learn to move side to side. We are talking rotation. Again, think about moving from the hips. It\u2019s easiest to visualize proper rotation if you think about your waist. We don\u2019t want any movement at the waist. Try to picture your rib cage being locked on to your pelvis. That\u2019s what you want. Pretend that there are no joints between your ribs and pelvis, for this one. \nFull-Body Rotation\nThe chest, navel, and hips all move together. This means there is no (or very little) movement in the spine. The body rotates by moving the hips, knees, and pelvis. If the hips and pelvis stay facing forward while the rib cage moves, the movement comes from the waist, and therefore the lumbar spine. This type of movement can wear down the discs and joints in the spine over time, especially when additional load is applied (like unloading the dishwasher for instance). Just like hip-hinging, rotation done properly doesn\u2019t cause you to lose mobility and will improve athletic performance. Let\u2019s give it a try. Once again, the new movement is not that hard. But you are trying to unlearn a lifetime of moving with your spine. That is hard. \n\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Set your posture: Find neutral spine, brace the core, shoulders back, stand as tall as you can without pain and without breaking neutral spine. \nStep 3: Bend your knees slightly. \nStep 4: Place your hands on the top of your pelvis with your fingers pointed forward. This hand position is to help you visualize movement of the pelvis as you get used to this movement. \nStep 5: Keep the knees bent and loose but the core engaged, and try to turn a little to the right by shifting the knees and hips. Your fingers, navel, hip bones, chest bone, and face should all point the same direction. It\u2019s okay if you pivot the feet a little bit. \n\nStep 6: Now try to the left.\nStep 7: Slowly increase your range of motion by bending more at the knees. \nStep 8: Then increase your range of motion even more by pivoting your feet. \nStep 9: At all times and especially at the end of the movement, your chest bone, head, navel, and hips should be in alignment. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\nKnee pain: Stay lighter on your feet\\ and pivot the ball of the inside foot (the side you are moving away from) as you rotate. \nTorso Rotation with Hip-Hinge and Squat\nNow let\u2019s try to put those two movements\u2014the hip-hinge and the rotation\u2014together with a squat for a realistic, three-dimensional movement that allows you to accomplish everyday tasks (think unloading the dishwasher, putting up groceries) without stressing your back. You are going to rotate and bend down (hip-hinge), then come back up to the other side and extend. \nNotice that within that entire chain of movement, the person in the drawing does not really move his spine (look at the waist if you\u2019re having trouble visualizing that). The rib cage remains locked onto the pelvis the entire time. These pictures show you that you can go almost 180 degrees from side to side, stooping as low as you can and then extending as high as your hands can go, without compromising your back. Let\u2019s try it.\nStep 1: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nStep 2: Find neutral spine and engage your core to lock it in. \nStep 3: Stand with good posture. \nStep 4: Rotate torso to the right without twisting the waist as before.\n\nStep 5: Pivot the inside foot (left foot, in this case) as you turn.\nStep 6: After initiating the rotation, start to hinge at the hips, bending forward. Remember not to round your back. \n\nStep 7: Go only as low and as far to the right as you can without twisting at the waist or rounding your low back. You will now be in a squat/split squat position.\n\nStep 8: Reach out with your arms as if you were picking something up off of the floor. \n\nStep 9: Bring the arms back in and re-center your weight over your buttocks and feet. \nStep 10: Using your glutes, lift yourself out of the lowered position, pushing with your right glutes as you rotate back to midline while hinging back up through the hips. \n\nStep 11: As you swing past midline (without twisting at the waist!), pivot your right foot, continuing to use the right glutes, and extend your arms up toward the ceiling as if you were putting something on a shelf. \nStep 12: Return to the starting position without twisting at the waist. Try this in front of a mirror several times. \nStep 13: Then try this movement on the opposite side of your body. \nTROUBLESHOOTING\n\u2022 Knee pain: If your knees hurt as you start to rotate the torso, be lighter on your feet. Allow the feet to pivot a little bit. If the knees hurt when you are hinged forward at the bottom of the movement, drop your buttocks back more so that you are in a squat position (think of a baseball catcher) and lessen your range of motion. Try doing small movements and increase your range of motion gradually.\n\u2022 Back pain: If your back hurts with this one, it is likely you are twisting at the waist, rounding the back, or don\u2019t have the gluteal strength yet to perform this movement to its full range of motion. Do a little investigating: Can you hip-hinge without pain? If so, that\u2019s not the issue. Can you do the torso rotation without pain? Can you squat without pain? If you can do all three without pain then it is likely you are having difficulty putting all of these moves together without sacrificing form on one of them. Try doing this movement in very small pieces in front of a mirror or loved one, and gradually increase your range of motion over time. If any one piece causes pain, work on that one until you can do it pain-free, and then come back and try this movement again. \nRemember, these movements must become habits. That sounds daunting but it really isn\u2019t that hard. Once your back starts to feel better, it will let you know when you move the wrong way and you\u2019ll avoid that at all costs.", "length": 3788}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER NINETEEN\n Congratulations! And One Last Assignment\n From Chris and Jeremy\nFrom Chris\nFirst of all, congratulations. You have read and (let us hope) absorbed the critical pieces of the James Protocol. That\u2019s the big deal; the vast majority of you are now equipped to work on your own to end or radically reduce your back pain, forever. Let me recap: You have learned some moves to help you step out of back pain in the short term so that you can embark on the regimen of exercises and movements that are going to solve the problem in the long term. You have learned how to stop doing the things that got you into this mess in the first place (\u201cstop doing dumb stuff\u201d). You have also learned how to build up endurance and strength in your core. Finally, you have learned how to move in all dimensions while maintaining a neutral spine and bracing your core. That is, you have learned how to move in daily life and do moderate exercise, without hurting your wretched back. Overall, you have learned how to behave differently, and that will make all the difference. Nice work. Very, very nice work. Continue with what you\u2019ve learned and do the basic exercises every day (hey, it\u2019s only for the rest of your life), and there is every reason to hope that most of you will be pain-free (or almost pain-free) from now on. Read the book again, from time to time, be rigorous about doing the exercises, and you\u2019re there.\nAlmost.\nThere is one more area that we have not covered (a book like this can be only so long) but which we want you to think about. And act on. Note that I said above that you were ready for \u201cmoderate exercise.\u201d Fine, if that\u2019s what you want. But if, as we hope, you decide to move back into the strenuous exercise that is such a joy to so many of us\u2014the rugged skiing, the flat-out tennis, the golf, the yoga, and so on\u2014you should think seriously about doing more than we have been able to tell you in the compass of this book. For you\u2014and, frankly, for almost everyone\u2014it makes a lot of sense to adopt a more comprehensive and demanding program of strength training than what we have outlined thus far in order to really strengthen your core and prepare to meet the special demands (for back-pain people) of serious exercise. Others may embark on serious exercise without doing all the core work (maybe), but those with a history of a bad back do so at their peril. Not a good idea. \nAs I say, we just can\u2019t do it here; it is almost another whole book. But we do have two great leads for you and some specific things to focus on (and avoid) as you turn to this phase.\nFirst, the ideas.\nFor a general, non-back-specific approach to strength training, you cannot do better than to get your hands on the book Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. It is a short but cutting-edge outline of strength training (with exercises by the brilliant Bill Fabrocini) as well as aerobic exercise, which is also key to your long-term recovery. It is not specifically back-oriented, but Bill Fabrocini is very sophisticated about back issues and his general strength-training guidance will serve you well. (Also, I cowrote it, so it is intermittently readable.)\nMore specifically, Jeremy has just completed a truly remarkable, video-based guide to back pain and exercise (of all kinds) called BackForever.com. As I now know so well, when it comes to back issues Jeremy is an absolute hound for precision, scientific soundness, and detail, and he has worked his tail off to make his subscription video protocol (with some 150 separate videos on absolutely everything) as good and comprehensive as video can be. I have seen \u2019em, and they\u2019re amazing.\nActually, if it were my back, I\u2019d buy the book (it\u2019s cheap) and subscribe to BackForever.com (the price of a couple of sessions with a personal trainer). If you do the same, we guarantee you\u2019ll end your back pain and live happily ever after. No, we don\u2019t, but damn near.\nBefore we turn you loose, we want to give you some warnings about strength training in general and a couple of specific tips about things to avoid. \nTHE BODYBUILDING BLUNDER\nThe first step for a lot of us, as we turn to strength training, is to \u201cget over\u201d the \u201cbodybuilder\u201d or \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d mentality of the 1960s and \u201970s and beyond. In those decades, the new exercise machines\u2014Nautilus and others\u2014were all in vogue, as was the focus on bodybuilding, thanks in significant part to Arnold Schwarzenegger and the movie Pumping Iron. The idea was to build big biceps (\u201cguns\u201d), huge quads, and whatnot. And to become strong. Then I guess you head down to the beach so Gidget and the Baywatch babes could swarm around. And the way you built those guns and whatnot, mostly, was with the nifty new weightlifting machines, especially the Nautilus gadgets. The ostensible genius of the Nautilus machines was that they gave constant stress across the full range of a rep. True, too, and a good idea. But the real appeal of the machines, I bet, was that in some curious way they made weightlifting \u201ceasy.\u201d You still had to hoist heavy weights and grunt and sweat and stuff. But the machines did a lot of the hardest and most subtle work. They took all the balance out of strength training. And most of the coordination. Which permitted you to do what bodybuilders wanted to do then which was to isolate and grow the big muscles: the quads, your pecs, your biceps, and so on. It was much easier to do all that if you did not have to bother with the pesky business of balancing and stabilizing yourself. \nIn the normal course of weight training (when you were not using strength machines), stability (and coordination) was mostly the work of little support muscles and groups of muscles surrounding the big muscles. The machines did most of that for you. Which was nice. Except for this: The little guys\u2014the support muscles\u2014atrophied or died. Which was dangerous and dumb. \nBecause our body is designed to work\u2014virtually all the time\u2014on a fully integrated, whole-body basis. And that is impossible without the help of the little guys. Athletic movements (and most real-life movements) do not use isolated muscles; they use the whole shebang. Movement and exercise is orchestral, not a series of solos. Every lift in the real world is a whole-body affair. Isolating the big boys while letting the little guys go to hell was an absolutely awful idea. Bill Fabrocini (one of the great leaders in the whole-body training field and coauthor of two Younger Next Year books on the subject) sees hundreds of well-intentioned, serious people now in their sixties and seventies who have been \u201cmuscle isolation\u201d weightlifters all their lives. They have huge muscles and can hoist great weight with them. But for the activities of daily life or normal exercise, they are weak as kittens. They are wretched athletes (if they can move at all). And often their backs and necks are aching ruins. Because the little muscles, which are key to whole-body movement, have gone to hell and their bodies are agonizingly out of alignment. It is possible to save these poor souls but it takes forever. Unsurprisingly, it is mostly a matter of teaching them to get over the machines and the muscle isolation model and learn whole-body, integrated workouts. Mostly you use your own body weight in integrated exercises, without machines. (Note: You do not have to give up machines completely; they can be a useful supplement to a whole-body regimen, if used properly.) \nDid that help? I hope so. Because it is important to grasp the significance of integrated, whole-body strength training. It is only integrated, whole-body movement that is going to build the kind of strength and movement patterns that are going to enable you to return to those higher risk activities. And make no mistake: You are almost certainly going to have to develop a much stronger core if it is going to be able to do its great job in protecting your back for serious exercise. \nFrom Jeremy\nLet me expand upon the muscle isolation theme a bit. Often it may be necessary to isolate muscles when deficiencies are present in those particular muscles, to reestablish strength and balance within the body so that a full-body exercise can be performed properly. But, after these rehabilitative goals are accomplished, integrated movement using the core for stability while incorporating balance is essential. With most machines, you are sitting there, exerting maximum force across one joint\u2014your elbow, say\u2014while the machine does all the stabilizing and balancing. That puts dangerous amounts of load across that joint. Bodybuilding focuses on developing muscle hypertrophy, meaning an increase in muscle mass. A specific muscle or set of muscles is isolated with a machine and moved against resistance until that muscle gets big. Various muscles throughout the body are put through this process individually to achieve a certain look, with no thought given to linking the muscles together to mimic the movements of sport or daily activities. This does nothing to train the muscles and muscle systems to move . . . to work together for maximum efficiency and minimum joint damage. As we age, it is crucial to challenge the systems in our bodies that maintain balance and stability. As the saying goes, use it or lose it. \nInstead of bodybuilding, we want you to think of training muscle systems and movements. A maxim I hear Bill say all the time that is common in the profession is \u201cTrain movement, not muscles,\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Your goal in the gym is to build up the systems of muscles that support the movements of daily life, work, and sport, not to build \u201cguns\u201d for the beach. \nYou also need to get out of the mind-set that to work your core you must be doing core-specific exercises. It doesn\u2019t work that way. All whole-body exercises are core exercises. The core muscles are designed to stop movement, not produce movement. Think about that for a minute. The core muscles are there to stop your spine and torso from moving while loads are applied through the arms and legs. Their primary function isn\u2019t so much to move the torso as to keep it still. For example, if you are standing on your own two feet with nothing to lean against and pull a cable that has resistance, it is your core that is keeping your body from twisting and becoming off balance when you pull the cable. The stronger the resistance on the cable, the stronger your core has to be to resist that resistance. Juxtapose this with sitting on a \u201cseated row\u201d machine, where your chest is against a pad and you pull enormous amounts of weight, straining against the pad to keep your body in place, and you get the picture. \nDETAILS\nJust as in your daily exercises laid out in painstaking detail in this book thus far, the specific little details matter in strength training with weights, too. In fact, the stakes are higher because the load is higher and there is far less room for error. Regarding weight training, your goals dictate the degree of risk you are willing to assume. All weight training requires you to assume some degree of risk. If your goal is to get back to being an NBA center, that risk is pretty high because we are going to subject you to enormous loads in somewhat dangerous positions, but it\u2019s worth it if you need to get back to your multimillion-dollar-a-year job. If your goal is to get back to being a grandma who can safely pick up her grandchild, the risk is much lower. And if your goal is to get back to recreational golf a few times a week, your risk is somewhere in the middle. It is for these reasons and because of the complexity of the movements we are discussing that presenting a one-size-fits-all strength-training regimen in this book is nearly impossible. Therefore we decided that rather than present you with an inferior product, we would give you an overview of the general information here and present you with some options to further your interests in a much more individualized way. \nAs you know, Chris and I are both huge fans of Bill Fabrocini\u2019s warm-ups and exercises in Younger Next Year: The Exercise Program. They provide a superb foundation for general strength training. If you want a more customized workout tailored to the protection and strengthening of your back check out my BackForever.com online membership program with streaming videos and other content referred to in the Appendix. It was my goal to make it the definitive, visual guide in this area.\nAnother option of course is to hire a personal trainer until you get comfortable with the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of strength training. A great personal trainer can be a huge help. But be warned, personal trainers vary wildly in skill level and knowledge. It can be very difficult to find a good one. Asking potential trainers if they are familiar with the concepts we talk about in this book is a good starting point. Also ask how much experience they have with working with clients with back pain. Ask them for referrals and interview those people if possible. Chris and I hope to solve the problem of finding a good trainer by creating a certification program down the road. Depending on where you live, expect to pay anywhere from $75 to $200 per hour for a great personal trainer. \nFrom Chris and Jeremy \nFinally, we also want to drive home the point about strength exercises that are bad for you. There are a few that you just shouldn\u2019t be doing.

{"prompt": "CHAPTER ONE\n The Promise\n From Chris\nBack pain is the monster in most of our lives. The ogre under the bed. The ogre that lands you in bed all too often. Or on the floor . . . flopping around in pain. Like a sunfish on a hot cement dock. \nMost Americans know that pain well. Know the agony, the sudden sickening return after it\u2019s been gone for a while. The canceling of plans, the loss of a job. Everything. They cannot live with it\u2014not really live\u2014and they would do anything for relief. But there is no relief. They\u2019ve tried everything, and nothing works. Nothing meaningful, anyway. Back pain sufferers spend an average of $2,500 a year for palliative \u201cfixes,\u201d but they get precious little in return. They\u2019d spend more\u2014they\u2019d spend anything\u2014if the fixes really worked. But most don\u2019t. Or not very well. Or not for long. People structure their lives around the pain as best they can, but that doesn\u2019t work either, because you never know when it\u2019s going to hit. \nAnd when it comes, it\u2019s not like a sore shoulder or a bum leg; you can\u2019t use the other arm instead. You can\u2019t limp along with a cane, relying on the good leg. When your back is the problem, everything goes, and you\u2019re cooked. When your back hurts, your life hurts. And you can\u2019t do a damned thing. \nTHE PROMISE\nThat is about to end. You are going to have trouble believing that sentence, but it\u2019s true. That pain is about to go away or be sharply reduced. And the change is going to be permanent. For about 80 percent of you, anyway. That\u2019s an astonishing promise, and it\u2019s absolutely true. We know of nothing else in the field that comes close. \n\u201cSuccess\u201d means either the permanent elimination of pain (the result for most of you) or a reduction of its severity from the 7\u201310 level\u2014on a scale of 1\u201310 (that\u2019s agony)\u2014to the 1\u20133 level (that\u2019s a nuisance). Blessed, blessed relief, either way. As I say, it is only going to work for about 80 percent of you, but that\u2019s a near-miracle. And Jeremy has solid suggestions for the rest of you, too. (See Chapter 4 to learn if you\u2019re in the 20 percent and find out what to do.) But remember the main point: For 80 percent of you, the pain stops here.\nWe hope that the \u201cyou\u201d in that sentence is an enormous number of people. Jeremy is a modest man but he knows what he can do\u2014what he has done\u2014and he is ambitious about taking his protocol to a much broader audience. Indeed, he wants to start a revolution in back pain care in America, starting with you, and he wants it to be universal and cheap. He thinks\u2014he and I think\u2014that it can be done in a book. That sounds wild\u2014that this horrendous problem can be fixed with such a modest tool. But it\u2019s not. Because back pain is all about behavior, and you can deal with behavior in a book. As you will learn in a moment, the vast majority of you created your back pain with your own, long-term behavior. And only you can fix it, with profound changes in that behavior. It is a matter of showing you what you did before that made a mess of your back, and teaching you what you have to do now. And then you doing it. Jeremy explains, and he shows you how. You do the work. You will succeed. A surprise, perhaps one you will have trouble getting your head around at first. But it\u2019s true: You will succeed. \nSo how bad is the problem? Pretty bad, as most of you know. Four out of five of us have back pain so bad we seek help from health care professionals. The nation as a whole spends $100 billion on the problem. It does more to disrupt business than anything else. And, of course, it raises hell with millions of lives. For some, it is a recurring nuisance, something that takes the joy out of the day, the week, the month. For more of us, it is an intermittent horror, with the pain at the agony level and we just can\u2019t move. Your wife calls your host for dinner: \u201cBill is flat on his back on the floor. We may have to go to the hospital. Sorry.\u201d You can\u2019t go out to dinner; you can\u2019t perform your duties. Hell, you can\u2019t get off the floor! It ruins careers, messes up companies, trashes marriages, and raises holy hell with just about everything else. For most, it comes and goes, but when it comes . . . it\u2019s just god-awful. Oh lord! What do you do?\nNot much, until now. There\u2019s conventional medicine\u2014which is such a blessing in so many areas of our lives\u2014but it is apt not to be great for back pain. For extreme cases (the 20 percent we mentioned), there is surgery, and for them it may be the only option; Jeremy will alert those who should be thinking about it. But surgery\u2014tremendously important and successful for some\u2014is not the answer for most of you. It is well known, for example, that at least one popular operation\u2014spinal fusion\u2014is one of the most overprescribed operations in the country. It is a serious operation (it costs about $100,000), it is often unnecessary, and it often doesn\u2019t work. Not for long, anyway, and sometimes not at all. That is scary. Jeremy, and the best surgeons, all say that surgery should be a last resort. There are other \u201cmedical\u201d steps, like cortisone or other shots, but, once again, relief is temporary, there can be serious side effects, and there are limits to how often you can go there. The basic problem with traditional medicine and back pain is that they are not a very good fit. Western medicine is not heavily focused on behavioral problems and behavioral change; it simply did not grow up that way. And back pain is primarily a behavioral problem. Which means that, ultimately, only you can fix it. \nDon\u2019t worry if this concept doesn\u2019t quite sink in at the first reading. It\u2019s what the whole book is about. We\u2019ll get there. Together. \nA Younger Next Year Book\nI say \u201cwe\u2019ll get there together,\u201d and that\u2019s an important part of the book and the cure. This is \u201ca Younger Next Year\u201d book. That means several things, as some of you know. First, it means there is a presentation by two writers, a deadly serious professional scientist (that\u2019s Jeremy for this book . . . it was Harry Lodge in the first Younger Next Year books) and a layman (me). As I used to say of Harry and as I now say of Jeremy: \u201cHe\u2019s young and smart, and I\u2019m old and funny.\u201d The pairing is supposed to make the book easier to follow (and maybe just a teeny bit fun to read) without losing a whisper of scientific integrity. The scientist is in charge throughout, but reading the book should not make your teeth hurt. Not hurt badly, anyway.\nIt also means that the core idea is that behavioral change can have a profound effect on your wellness and quality of life. Far more of an effect, in important areas, than the best conventional medicine. The \u201cmodest\u201d boast in the original Younger Next Year book was that behavioral change could put off 70 percent of aging until close to the end of life, and eliminate 50 percent of the most serious diseases completely. Which was absolutely true; no one has ever disagreed. Over 2 million people bought Younger Next Year (in twenty-three languages) and made it a cult book for those over forty, many thousands of whom profoundly changed their lives. A huge number of people have come up to me and Harry over the years to say, \u201cHey, man, thanks for writing that book; it changed my life.\u201d Nice.\nThe Younger Next Year Back Book is a little more specific: Behavioral change\u2014spelled out by Jeremy\u2014can end or radically reduce back pain. But the consequences for back pain sufferers are every bit as important. I was with Jeremy recently when a guy in his fifties said to me that he\u2019d come to Jeremy the previous summer, after a lifetime of serious back pain: \u201cI could not bend over to lace my own shoes. I\u2019d been in agony for decades. And Jeremy simply fixed it. Jeremy gave me my life back.\u201d Jeremy has a thousand stories like that. More than a thousand. We hope to have a million before we\u2019re done.\nFinally, it means that the book has a certain integrity. Harry and I went to great lengths to make Younger Next Year solid\u2014conservative, if anything. To the best of our knowledge, there was not a single exaggeration, and certainly not a single misstatement. Jeremy and I have done the same here. Dealing with back pain is an evolving field, and some things we say may turn out to be wrong as people learn more. But not the basic lines and not the major claims. The book is as solid as we can make it, and it will stand up. As Younger Next Year has done, strikingly. \nJeremy came to me with the idea for doing this book together because he thought YNY and his story had \u201cthe same genes.\u201d Which was quite right. Beyond that, Jeremy is a \u201cgood guy\u201d; he wants to do good in this world, and the fact that back pain makes such a mess of so many lives\u2014unnecessarily in his view\u2014makes him crazy. He knew how successful the Younger Next Year books had been, he knew me, and he thought that maybe the two of us could pair up and get the word out . . . change the world of back pain.\nSo that\u2019s our modest goal here\u2014first Jeremy\u2019s and now mine: We just want to, you know, change the world. And eliminate back pain for millions. Hey, couldn\u2019t hurt. Along the way we hope to make a couple of billion dollars ourselves but Jeremy\u2019s great motivation is to change the world of back pain. Pretty good guy, Jeremy. \nNow, let\u2019s have a quiet word about some things this book won\u2019t do. It won\u2019t do any good if you just stick it under your pillow, for example. You have to read it. Closely. We\u2019ll make that as easy as we can but it ain\u2019t always going to be a walk on the beach. Then, by heaven, you have to go to work yourself on the cure. You have to do the initial fixes yourself. And then you have to adopt Jeremy\u2019s carefully tailored exercise regimen to make the cure permanent, and that\u2019s not always easy. Well, it\u2019s easy if you know how, and we work like crazy to show you how in the book (and in videos we\u2019ll refer to in a minute). \nFinally, you have to know\u2014as I said before\u2014that the book may not work for some of you. You\u2019re too far gone. Awfully damn sorry about that but about 20 percent of you\u2014Jeremy estimates, conservatively\u2014are going to have progressed to a stage where you are probably going to need traditional medical help, possibly including surgery. He\u2019ll tell you how to know if that means you. And a few more of you\u2014with back pain that is rooted primarily in muscle \u201ctrigger points\u201d (there\u2019s a terrific chapter on that)\u2014may need to turn to a chiropractor or physical therapist, at least briefly, to show you how to find and release muscle spasms. Then you come back to the book to lock in the change and make it permanent. But the basic claim\u2014that some 80 percent of you can get complete or significant pain relief permanently\u2014is solid. \nI asked Jeremy, early on, if he could back up that number by going through his records. He said he could not. (Oh, lord!) But, he said, he could remember every single one of the handful of patients he thought he could help who in fact he could not (excluding the ones he sent on for conventional medical help). He could count them on his fingers. I thought that was good enough. So, that 80 percent claim is not just solid, it is conservative.\nBasic Insight: You Got Yourself into This Mess, and Only You Can Get Yourself Out \nJeremy\u2019s success has been based on two great insights. The first was to realize (along with a handful of others, including Bill Fabrocini, who wrote the Introduction) that your own long-term behavior (how you carry yourself, your posture, and certain repetitive movements) is almost always the cause of your back pain. Sometimes it\u2019s trauma or a weird event but not often. And only changing behavior is going to effect a permanent cure. In other words, it\u2019s going to be up to you in the end. Jeremy will point the way and tell you exactly what to do: first to effect the cure and then to do maintenance. But you do the hard work. And\u2014as in the other Younger Next Year books\u2014exercise is going to be at the heart of it. Steady, whole-body exercise for the rest of your life. If you\u2019re new to all this, that may sound alarming\u2014steady exercise forever\u2014but it\u2019s not. In this, as in other things, exercise is going to turn out to be the key to the good life. \nThe second great insight was to realize that, while back pain seems local and specific, it is almost always a whole-body or at least whole-core problem in the end (we\u2019ll tell you all about the core in a bit). And a whole-body approach is indispensable to its cure. Drawing on those two insights, on his review of the available science, and on his own vast, clinical experience (he has been doing nothing but treating back pain his whole adult life), Jeremy has developed a technique that has had unprecedented success. \nYou are probably a bit of a student of back pain yourself if you\u2019ve had it for a while, but you are about to learn some new things. You will learn, for example, that back pain is not a \u201cdisease,\u201d as some doctors say. Nor, in most cases, is it the result of an accident or trauma. Or bad genes or bad luck. Or (mostly) psychological issues. Sometimes, but mostly not. And it is not from rolling over \u201cfunny\u201d in the night or picking up something heavy, carelessly. Or making love in some goofy and disgusting way. It\u2019s not the malfunction of a particular disc", "length": 3383}

Pls.\u2019 56.1, ECF No. 113, \u00b6 1. They obtain from authors the exclusive rights to publish books in print and digital formats, including electronic copies of books, or \u201cebooks.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 63-68. Publishers and authors generally are paid for sales of each format in which a book is published. Id. \u00b6 65. The defendant, Internet Archive (\u201cIA\u201d), is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing \u201cuniversal access to all knowledge.\u201d Def.\u2019s 56.1, ECF No. 98, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Brewster Kahle, IA\u2019s Chairman, founded the organization in 1996. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 216. One of IA\u2019s first projects was to document the history of the Internet by archiving every public webpage on the World Wide Web through IA\u2019s \u201cWayback Machine.\u201d Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 5. IA also works with libraries, museums, universities, and the public to preserve and offer free online access to texts, audio, moving images, software, and other cultural artifacts. Id. \u00b6 6.\n\nThis dispute concerns the way libraries lend ebooks. Public and academic libraries in the United States spend billions of dollars each year obtaining print books and ebooks for their patrons to borrow for free. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 113. Libraries usually buy their print books from publishers or wholesalers. Id. \u00b6 114. Copies of ebooks, however, are typically not bought but licensed to libraries from publishers through distributors called \u201caggregators.\u201d Id. \u00b6 117. The Publishers task aggregators with ensuring that a library lends its ebooks only to the library\u2019s members. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 123, 125. The Publishers also require aggregators to employ approved \u201cdigital rights management\u201d (\u201cDRM\u201d) software and other security measures to prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of ebook files. Id. \u00b6 126. Demand for library ebooks has increased over the past decade. In 2012, OverDrive, the largest aggregator, processed 70 million digital checkouts of ebooks and audiobooks; by 2020, that number had risen to 430 million. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 119, 164.\n\nThe Publishers use several licensing models to profit from the distribution of ebooks to libraries. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 120, 122. All four Publishers offer a \u201cone-copy, one-user\u201d model: Libraries pay a single fee for an ebook and patrons check out a copy of that ebook successively, subject to community-based and DRM restrictions. Id. \u00b6 127. Each Publisher offers academic libraries a perpetual term under this model, and Wiley grants perpetual one-copy, one-user licenses to academic and public libraries alike. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 130-132. Hachette and Penguin limit their one-copy, one-user licenses for public libraries to one- or two-year terms, during which there is no limit on the number of times an ebook can be read and after which a library must purchase a new license. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 134, 147. HarperCollins uses a \u201c26-Circ Model,\u201d which allows libraries to circulate an ebook twenty-six times, over any time period, before the license expires. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 135-140. HarperCollins and Penguin also use a Pay-Per-Use model -- a onetime circulation to a single patron at a significantly reduced fee -- and Wiley has experimented with various subscription models. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 141-146, 155, 191. The Publishers\u2019 library expert testified, and IA does not dispute, that this \u201cthriving ebook licensing market for libraries\u201d has \u201cincreased in recent years\u201d and \u201cis predicated on licensing revenues that are paid by libraries to entities like OverDrive.\u201d Id. \u00b6 168. For example, library ebook licenses generate around $59 million per year for Penguin. Id. \u00b6 170. Between 2015 and 2020, HarperCollins earned $46.91 million from the American library ebook market. Id. \u00b6 172.\n\nIA offers readers a different way to read ebooks online for free. Over the past decade, IA has scanned millions of print books and made the resulting ebooks publicly available on its archive.org and openlibrary.org websites (together, the \u201cWebsite\u201d). Id. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 236; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 12. IA\u2019s basic modus operandi is to acquire print books directly or indirectly, digitally scan them, and distribute the digital copies while retaining the print copies in storage. The Open Library of Richmond (the \u201cOpen Library\u201d), another non-profit organization run by Brewster Kahle, buys or accepts donations of print books, primarily from Better World Books (\u201cBWB\u201d), a for-profit used bookstore affiliated with IA and the Open Library. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 313-314, 317, 322, 338. The Open Library then sends the books to IA scanning centers, where operators turn and photograph each page using a book-digitization device called a \u201cScribe.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 281-283. After scanning, the print books are stored in doublestacked shipping containers and are not circulated. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 310- 312; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 23.\n\nIA\u2019s Website includes millions of public domain ebooks that users can download for free and read without restrictions. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 158, 160. Relevant to this action, however, the Website also includes 3.6 million books protected by valid copyrights, including 33,000 of the Publishers\u2019 titles and all of the Works in Suit. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 240; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 160. The Publishers did not authorize IA to create digital copies of the Works in Suit or to distribute those unauthorized ebook editions on IA\u2019s Website. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 243.\n\nIA does not make its ebook copies of copyright-protected works available for mass download. Instead, it professes to perform the traditional function of a library by lending only limited numbers of these works at a time through \u201cControlled Digital Lending,\u201d or \u201cCDL.\u201d Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 11. CDL\u2019s central tenet, according to a September 2018 Statement and White Paper by a group of librarians, is that an entity that owns a physical book can scan that book and \u201ccirculate [the] digitized title in place of [the] physical one in a controlled manner.\u201d Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 436. CDL\u2019s most critical component is a one-to-one \u201cowned to loaned ratio.\u201d Id. Thus, a library or organization that practices CDL will seek to \u201conly loan simultaneously the number of copies that it has legitimately acquired.\u201d Id. \u201cFor example, if a library owns three copies of a title and digitizes one copy, it may use CDL to circulate one digital copy and two print, or three digital copies, or two digital copies and one print; in all cases, it could only circulate the same number of copies that it owned before digitization.\u201d Id. According to IA, CDL is especially helpful for patrons who live far from a brick-andmortar library, patrons seeking a book not available from their local library, patrons with disabilities that make it difficult to hold or read print books, and patrons who want brief or spontaneous access to books and for whom it would not be worth a trip to a brick-and-mortar library. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 55-56. \n\nUnder IA\u2019s implementation of CDL, two factors determine the number of digital copies of a book that can be borrowed at any time from IA\u2019s Website. Id. \u00b6 50. First, IA makes available one digital copy for each non-circulating print book it keeps in storage. Id. \u00b6 51. Second, IA partners with libraries to \u201ccontribute\u201d the number of their print copies of the book toward the number of lendable copies on IA\u2019s Website. Id. \u00b6 52. Even if a partner library has multiple copies of a book, IA counts only one additional copy per library. Id. For example, if IA owns one non-circulating print copy of Laura Ingalls Wilder\u2019s Little House on the Prairie (1932), and three partner libraries each contribute a copy of the book, IA would lend its digital copy of Little House on the Prairie to up to four patrons at a time. Id. \u00b6 53.2\n\nAround 2018, IA began expanding significantly its lending capacity of copyright-protected works through the \u201cOpen Libraries\u201d project. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 355. Libraries now can \u201cpool[] their physical collections\u201d with IA \u201cin order to make more lendable copies of digital books available to their users and the world.\u201d Id. \u00b6 363. To participate, a Partner Library sends its catalogue to IA to run an \u201coverlap analysis\u201d that compares ISBN numbers for the Partner Library\u2019s physical holdings with IA\u2019s digital holdings. Id. \u00b6 365. Whenever a book in the Partner Library\u2019s catalogue matches an ebook on IA\u2019s Website, IA increases by one the number of concurrent checkouts of that book allowed on the Website. Id. \u00b6 367. As of late 2021, 62 Partner Libraries, including 13 public libraries, had contributed books through IA\u2019s overlap analysis. Id. \u00b6 392. IA encourages Partner Libraries to populate their websites with links to IA\u2019s Website. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 393-396. \n\nAnyone can become a patron of IA, and borrow up to ten ebooks at a time for up to fourteen days each, by submitting a valid email address. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. IA never charges patrons fees for any service, including borrowing books. Id. \u00b6 25. The Website has titles in popular categories, including Romance, Thrillers, \u201cBooks we Love,\u201d and \u201cTrending Books.\u201d Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 514-516. Patrons can read books they have checked out on IA\u2019s BookReader web browser platform, or they can download a \u201cHigh Quality\u201d encrypted PDF or ePub version of the ebook.3 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 207-209, 277; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34. IA secures its downloadable versions with software that prevents the patron from copying, accessing, or distributing the book after the loan period. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 34. The BookReader application also has a \u201cRead Aloud\u201d feature that converts the text to audio and plays it aloud. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6 276. After a book is checked out, a \u201cPurchase at Better World Books\u201d button appears at the top of the browser window. Id. \u00b6 346. This button links to BWB\u2019s website, where patrons can buy a used print copy of the book. Id. \u00b6 347. BWB pays IA whenever someone buys a book after using the \u201cPurchase at Better World Books\u201d link. Id. IA\u2019s Website also includes a link to \u201cDonate\u201d to IA. Id. \u00b6 348.\n\nIn March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic closed libraries nationwide and, by IA\u2019s estimation, took 650 million print books out of circulation. Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 70. Judging itself \u201cuniquely positioned to be able to address this problem quickly and efficiently,\u201d on March 24, 2020, IA launched what it called the National Emergency Library (\u201cNEL\u201d), intending it to \u201crun through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 72, 74. During the NEL, IA lifted the technical controls enforcing its one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio and allowed up to ten thousand patrons at a time to borrow each ebook on the Website. Pl.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 542-543, 547. IA ended the NEL on June 16, 2020, shortly after this action was filed, and returned to its \u201ctraditional controlled digital lending,\u201d which remains in effect. Id. \u00b6 571; Def.\u2019s 56.1 \u00b6 96.\n\nIn the two years after the NEL, IA\u2019s user base increased from 2.6 million to about 6 million. Pls.\u2019 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 248, 250. As of 2022, IA hosts about 70,000 daily ebook \u201cborrows.\u201d Id. \u00b6 249.", "length": 3572}

{"prompt": "CHAPTER SEVEN\nEMAIL MARKETING\n\nWhat is Email Marketing?\nEmail marketing is a form of direct marketing that gives companies the opportunity to\ncommunicate with customers on their contact list regarding new products, sales, and\nother updates. Because of its high ROI, it is an essential component of the overall inbound\nstrategy for the majority of businesses.\nConsent, segmentation, and personalization are the three main focuses of modern email\nmarketing, which has shifted away from sending out generic mass mailings and toward a\nmore targeted approach. Although it might sound like a time-consuming process,\nmarketing automation actually takes care of the majority of the hard work for you. Not\nonly does a well-designed strategy for email marketing help drive sales in the long run,\nbut it also assists in the development of a community that is centered on your brand.\n\nTypes of marketing emails\nEmail marketing can take the form of promotional messages, informational emails, or\nemails that serve a speci c function in the buyer's journey.\n\nPromotional emails\nEmail marketing campaigns can be used to promote limited-time sales and discounts,\nnewly released products, gated content such as ebooks and webinars, and your brand in\ngeneral. A campaign might include sending anywhere from three to ten emails over the\ncourse of several days or weeks.\nEmails used for marketing purposes always include a distinct \"call-to-action,\" or CTA for\nshort. The call to action (also known as the CTA) is the speci c action that you want the\nreader to take, such as viewing a particular page on your website or making use of a\ncoupon to make a purchase.\nThe frequency with which you send out emails of this kind is typically determined by the\nsales and marketing cadence of your company. It's possible that you'll send multiple\npromotional emails within the same twenty-four-hour period during crucial times of the\nyear like Black Friday. There might be a gap of a few weeks between each of your\npromotional campaigns depending on when in the marketing calendar slower periods\noccur.\n\nInformational emails\n\nNewsletters: As the word \"newsletter\" suggests, the purpose of a newsletter is to\ndisseminate information concerning your company. Consider having reached new\nmilestones, introducing new product capabilities, or highlighting valuable content such as\ncase studies. Newsletters, especially those that are sent at regular intervals (weekly, bi-\nweekly, or monthly), help maintain consistent touch points with the email subscribers you\nhave.\nHowever, were you aware that newsletters don't necessarily need to be about news?\nListen to what email guru Ann Handley has to say and concentrate on the letter aspect.\nImagine that you are writing a letter to each of your subscribers individually about a topic\nthat pertains to something that interests them.\nTo put it more simply, a newsletter is an opportunity to share insights, thoughts, and tips\nwith your audience. This could be anything that they nd valuable.\nEmail is the ideal medium for disseminating information to customers regarding company\nannouncements, new product releases, modi cations to the service, and other similar\ntopics.\nEmail is the primary mode of communication for vital messages the vast majority of the\ntime. Keeping in touch with your contacts through email is the most e ective method of\ncommunication in the event that there is a problem with your website, a holdup in the\nshipping process, or an interruption in your system or software. It is safe, it can be done\ninstantly, and it can have the same level of formality as the most important announcements.\n\nRe-engagement emails\nThe re-engagement email is an additional type of marketing email that is very important.\nRe-engagement emails, which are exactly what they sound like, are used to re-establish\ncommunication with clients or subscribers who have become inactive in recent times.\n\nWHY EMAIL MARKETING IS IMPORTANT\n\nEmail is not a recently developed technology. In point of fact, it was one of the very rst\ndigital communication methods to be developed and introduced in the year 1971.\nHowever, despite having been around for half a century, email marketing is more popular\nthan it has ever been.\nIt's possible that you're wondering to yourself, \"Do people really still use email?\" Isn't it true\nthat social media marketing is where it's at these days?\" Even though it's true that social\nmedia is an essential channel for any digital marketing strategy, email has a number of\nbene ts that set it apart from the competition.\nTo begin, marketing campaigns conducted via email allow for a greater degree of\npersonalization than those conducted via social media. Next, the costs of email marketing\nare signi cantly lower than those of other channels, which is especially advantageous\nwhen one considers the scope of the audience and the percentage of leads that are\nconverted. This is one of the many reasons why email marketing is such a good t for\nsmaller companies.\nIn conclusion, what makes email marketing so e ective and lucrative is the fact that it\nprovides you with direct and individual access to the inboxes of your target audience.\n\nHow to Do Email Marketing\n\nWhen it comes to sending promotional emails, companies make use of a category of\nsoftware known as email service providers, or ESP.\nA software that facilitates the sending of and management of email marketing campaigns\nis known as an email service provider.\nIt is also referred to as an email marketing service, an email marketing tool, and email\nmarketing software. Other names for it include an email marketing platform.\nYou may be thinking at this point, \"Why can't I just use my regular email service provider\nto send out marketing emails?\" Do I truly require the additional expense of purchasing a\nproduct on top of that?\nIt is feasible from a technical standpoint. However, exercise caution. There is a high\nprobability that you will experience di culties with your restricted email bandwidth,\ndesign, and most importantly, email deliverability. This is why:\nInternet Service Providers (ISPs) such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and the like were created\nfor individual use and are not suitable for sending out mass emails. They do not, despite\nthe fact that they are free to use, come with a free bulk email sender. Therefore, when a\nmass email is sent from an Internet service provider (ISP), it is very easy for spam lters to\nidentify it as spam, and your account could be disabled for suspicious activity.\nOn the other hand, email service providers (ESPs) have the infrastructure necessary to\nensure good email deliverability rates. This refers to the ability to successfully deliver\nemails to the inboxes of your subscribers. Investing in a dedicated email marketing service\nis the best way to ensure that your email marketing e orts are successful from the very\nbeginning.\nHow to choose an email service provider\nBecause there are hundreds of ESPs available, it can be challenging to determine which\none is best for your company.\nSendinblue, Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Convertkit, Mailjet, Mailerlite, and HubSpot are\namong the most widely used options. Mailjet, Mailerlite, and HubSpot are also among the\nmost widely used.\nHere are some questions to help narrow down your options:\nWhat\u2019s your budget? If it\u2019s very limited, then cheap email marketing services should be your starting point.\nWhat kind of emails do you plan to send, and how often? This\u2019ll give you an idea of your required email volume (i.e. number of email sends).\nIf you\u2019ve already got a list of opt-in contacts, how many are there?\nWhat\u2019s your skill level when it comes to designing emails? If you\u2019re a complete beginner, you\u2019ll want a drag-and-drop email editor. Email templates will also come in handy. On the other hand, if you prefer to code emails from scratch, you\u2019ll be on the lookout for an HTML editor.\nDo you plan to set up automated email work ows? See what the ESP o ers in terms of email marketing automation. Some solutions only o er basic autoresponders.\nIf your business communicates with di erent buyer personas, what contact list segmentation capabilities are o ered?\nWill your business be sending transactional emails? (Note that these are not considered email marketing.) Some folks like to manage these emails with a separate service, while others prefer all emails under the same roof.\nYou should also give some thought to the requirements of the future. Have you settled on\na preferred ESP? Run some simulations with the following question: \"How much will this\nESP cost if my list grows to x?\" Does this electronic sportsbook (ESP) have the feature set\nto support me if I want to add x to my strategy? What kinds of integrations and applications am I going to be able to add on?\"\nIt's healthy to have a positive outlook on the future, but try not to get too carried away\nwith it. Obviously, you need to maintain your attention on what really matters for the time being.\nHow to get email lists for marketing\nYou won't be able to send email campaigns if there is no one to send them to, so it's time\nto start building a list of active subscribers who have opted in to receiving your messages.\nThat's right, you have the option to opt in. Because here's the thing about email contacts:\nEvery person on your email list needs to have given their express permission to be there\nin order to be included there.\nWhat exactly does that entail?\nWhen someone enters their email address into an email signup form on your blog,\nwebsite, landing pages, social media, or anywhere else, it indicates that they have\nconsented to receive emails from you in the future. \"Opt-in\" is the term used to refer to this\ntype of consent when discussing email. (What you mean by \"opting out\" is the same thing\nas \"unsubscribing.\")\nWhen it comes to complying with data protection laws and protecting the reputation of\nyour brand, permission-based marketing is an absolute necessity. After all, nobody likes a spammer\nBecause this is a fairly non-negotiable aspect of email marketing, the vast majority of\nESPs enable you to create signup forms so that your subscriber list can grow in a natural way.\nThe following is a list of tried-and-true methods for organically expanding your email list:\nAdd signup forms to your website and other places\nPut your email newsletter signup form in places where it will be seen by a lot of people\nand people will de nitely see it.\nBlog posts, the homepage, and the contact page are three common places where\nsubscribers can nd subscription forms. The addition of a pop-up form to your website is\nanother good idea to consider pursuing. Just make sure that the user experience is not\nsigni cantly altered by your changes. The use of pop-up windows that prevent visitors\nfrom accessing your website is a major turno . (Think of your signup form placement like\nyour call-to-action placement.)\nShare forms on social media by including a link in your bio or posts.\nMaintain or operate an e-commerce or online store? Include an option to sign up for the\nnewsletter as part of the process of checking out.\n\nUse lead magnets\n\nPremium content is the single most important factor in the growth of a list.\nThe distribution of password-protected content such as ebooks, reports, checklists, or\ninfographics can be an e ective means of expanding your contact list. In exchange for\nsigning up for your newsletter, visitors receive helpful content from your website. It's a win\nfor both sides! Check out these tips and tricks for content marketing to get additional\nideas and motivation!\nProviding people with unique opportunities to save money and sign up for your mailing\nlist is another excellent strategy. If you sign up for the newsletter of the clothing brand\nMango, for instance, you can receive a discount of ten percent on your very rst purchase.\n\nHow to design a marketing email\nCreating a design for an email does not have to be challenging or overly technical. You\ncan easily create stunning and professional marketing campaigns by using an editor that\nworks using a drag-and-drop interface.\nIt is not necessary to become preoccupied with the process of composing fancy and\nintricate emails. Creating an email that accurately represents your company's brand, in\nwhatever form that may take, should be your primary focus when composing electronic\ncorrespondence. In most cases, this entails maintaining a straightforward approach. You\nwill undoubtedly be able to improve upon this in the not-too-distant future.\n\nSave time with pre-made email templates\nEmail marketing templates are the ideal short cut to outstanding email design, and they\nare suitable for use by both novices and seasoned professionals.\nJust pick one you like. Adjust the colors and font to correspond with the aesthetic of your\nbrand. After that, you can recycle it for use in future email newsletters. Keeping the\ncontent current is all that will be required of you. Simple and uncomplicated!\n\nHow to write your email copy\n\nYour email copy needs to provide value, highlight topics that are interesting to your\naudience, and embody the tone of voice that your brand uses.\nTo write email copy that is persuasive and engaging, keep the following tips in mind:\nAsk yourself, \u201cWhat does my audience need from me? How can I help?\u201d Imagine you\u2019re writing to one person.\nShow your brand personality. Tell a story.\nWrite to instill curiosity, starting with the email subject line \u2014 more on that below. Use a conversational tone and write the way you speak.\nBreak up the copy with short paragraphs and use bullet points where possible.\nUse the name of a real person for the email signature instead of a faceless brand logo.\n\nWhen is the best time to send a marketing email?\n\nBe strategic when selecting the day and time to send your emails, rather than picking\nthem at random. Consider what you already know about the people who will be viewing\nyour presentation, and decide on a time that will be most bene cial for them.\nAccording to the ndings of some studies, email marketing campaigns have a greater\nchance of being successful when they are distributed on Tuesdays or Thursdays at\napproximately ten o'clock in the morning or in the afternoon at approximately three o'clock in the afternoon.\nHowever, what is successful for the majority of people may not be successful for you. It is\nessential to conduct experiments at a variety of times in order to determine the optimal\ntime for your audience.", "length": 3421}
{"prompt": "CHAPTER EIGHT\nINSTANT MESSAGE MARKETING AND CHAT BOTS\n\nThere has been some thought given to the possibility of using instant messaging for\nprofessional purposes. This concept was introduced to the western world by a urry of\nchatbots on Facebook; however, in China, WeChat had already established itself as a\ncommunication method for businesses and their customers. In other markets, such as\nIndia and Latin America, WhatsApp has also implemented this strategy. And given the\nnumber of people who are already conducting business communications through their\npersonal messaging platforms, we are compelled to inquire. How can we use instant\nmessaging for business in a way that is both e cient and scalable, and why should we do\nso?\nThe way in which we interact with businesses has recently been revolutionized as a result\nof a spate of live chat companies. Although it is enjoyable to chat with brands on their\nwebsite, there is a risk that a visitor will leave your website because of this feature. You can\nmake an e ort to reacquaint yourself through email, but keep in mind that most people's\ninboxes are already full.\nHOW INSTANT MESSAGING HELPS IN MARKETING\nInstant messaging (IM) appears to be the technology that is developing at the most rapid\nrate right now, in comparison to live video streaming or blogging. There are 990 million\npeople using WhatsApp, 800 million people using Facebook Messenger, and 650 million\npeople using WeChat. This makes the IM user base a pool of large and quickly growing\naddressable audiences. Despite this, marketers and businesses choose to ignore this\npowerful marketing tool because they view it as nothing more than a communication tool.\n\nThe following are four of the many ways that IM can assist marketers in selling their brand:\n\nOne-to-one Communication\n\nMessaging apps, on the other hand, are great for one-to-one communication, such as\nproviding personalized experiences to customers, elding questions from clients, and,\nmost importantly, making sales. Social media platforms are great for spreading information\nwidely and making things go viral. Because each message sent through a messaging app\nis one of a kind and crafted speci cally for the recipient, the experience is more intimate. It\nis now possible for companies to communicate directly with their customers via direct\nmessages, and what's even more exciting is that these messages are processed in the\nsame manner as those sent by friends.\n\nSegmented Reach\n\nThe targeting process is not complete without rst properly segmenting the audience that\nwill be targeted. You are able to share content with only one person at a time or with a\nsmall group of people when you use apps designed for instant messaging. The vast\nmajority of these apps allow for the creation of various sections or groups within the app\nitself. During a marketing campaign, they are likely the most valuable customers you really need to have.\nQuick Process\n\nInstant messaging provides communication that is both quick and non-parallel, which\nenables you to multitask while the customer service representative investigates the issue. It\nhelps areas with dropped signals to not hinder calls, which means that customer service\nrepresentatives will be able to work with multiple people at the same time.\n\nTrusted Method\n\nPeople use these apps to communicate with friends or people they already know, but\nthere is always a fear that their privacy will be violated while they are online because of\nthe nature of the internet. The ability to unlock a phone with either Touch ID or facial\nrecognition has created the most secure platform that we have ever encountered. There\nis no longer a requirement for PIN numbers or passwords; instead, you will receive a\nstreamlined, personalized, and secure service at your ngertips.\nHigh Conversion Rate\nThe relatively higher engagement rate among fans can be attributed to the high level of\ntrust that exists between them, the quicker response rate, and the personalized human\ncommunication. The messages that are delivered via messaging apps are typically\nopened and read within a few minutes, which results in signi cantly more e cient\nmessage delivery. Marketers can communicate with nearly all of their followers who are\nincluded on their instant messaging list by making use of apps that are designed\nspeci cally for private messaging.\nNow that major players like Facebook and Google have entered the market for instant\nmessaging (IM), it is high time for advertising agencies and brands to get on board and\nstart reaping the bene ts that the all-powerful instant messaging apps have to o er.\n\nWHAT ARE CHATBOTS?\n\nChatbots are computer programs that are designed to interact with incoming messages in\nan automated fashion. Chatbots are able to be programmed to respond in the same way\neach time, to respond in a di erent way to messages containing certain keywords, and\neven to use machine learning to adapt their responses to t the circumstances.\nFor the purpose of receiving and responding to messages, chatbots utilize various chat\nmediums such as SMS text, website chat windows, and social messaging services across\nvarious platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.\nThere is a wide variety of chatbots. There are some silly and entertaining chatbots out\nthere, like Cleverbot, which converses with real people and picks up new skills as it goes along.\nIn addition, there are business bots that are designed to ful ll the needs of customers. A\nplethora of data demonstrating the value of bots for business was just recently made\npublic by Facebook:\n2 billion messages are sent between people and businesses monthly 56% of people would rather message than call customer service\n53% of people are more likely to shop with businesses they can message\n\nIn spite of the fact that chatbots have been around for some time, their application in\n\ncommercial settings has seen signi cant growth in the recent years. According to\ninformation obtained from Google Trends, the amount of people searching for \"chatbots\"\nhas increased by a factor of 19 over the course of the past ve years as people and\ncompanies have become aware of the value they provide.\n\nGetting Started with Chatbots\n\nAre you itching to get started developing your very own chatbots? Who wouldn't be\nconcerned? When you get over your initial apprehension of relying on assistance from a\nbot, the concept of building and releasing your very own bot can be very exciting. Think\nof all the time you'll save that you can put toward trying out new things.\nWhen getting started, we'll take you through the most important things to think about as\nwell as the steps to take.\n\n1. De ne Your Goal & Use Case\nIt can be di cult to zero in on a particular objective for chatbots because there is such a\nbroad spectrum of interesting use cases from which to choose. Invest some time up front\nin doing some discovery work to de ne your end goal, and then move on to the next\nstep of crafting your use case.\nDo you want to nd a solution to the problems with your customer service? Do you want\nto promote a new product? Or produce quali ed sales leads? Talk with the people who\nmanage your website and your social media accounts so that you can gure out which\nuse case will bene t you the most.\nIn the event that your social media team discovers that they are unable to keep up with\nthe number of messages on particular networks, you may want to consider utilizing bots\non those channels. If the team working on your website is experiencing low conversion\nrates, one possibility is that a bot can help increase those rates.\nIn any event, before you start eshing out the experience, give some thought to the goals\nyou have set for yourself and keep those in mind as you work.\n2. Choose Platforms to Leverage\n\nThe pages, networks, and channels that your programs are live on will each have their\nown unique feel to their chat conversations. Take into consideration the following:\n\nThe URL of your website Facebook Messenger\nA message sent privately through Twitter\nYour bots need to be programmed in such a way that they take into account the fact that\na user who accesses your homepage is likely more knowledgeable about your products\nthan a user who accesses one of your blog posts.\n\nIn a similar vein, due to the fact that the demographics of each individual social network\nare distinct from one another, a person who goes to your page on Facebook is not likely\nto ask the same questions as those who go to your page on Twitter. Examine the\ndemographics of social media platforms separately from those of social networks in order\nto gain a better understanding of these di erences.\n\nCollect as much information as you can about your target audience, and then use that\ninformation to direct the questions you ask in the third step.\n\n3. Build Out Your Content Strategy\n\nNext, determine what kinds of content you want your customers to interact with while using the chatbot to communicate with you.\nYou might want to begin with the FAQs. Think about the types of questions that\ncustomers are likely to ask your chatbot so that you can build the appropriate ows that\nwill lead users to the answer that is most bene cial to them.\nIf you are uncertain of the frequently asked questions, you should look inward to teams\nthat interact with your customers for the answers.\n\nCustomer Service: It's likely that the representatives working in customer service are the\nones who interact with customers more frequently than anyone else at your company.\nInquire with them about the patterns they observe in the questions asked by customers.\nYour company's sales representatives are the ones who most frequently interact with\npotential customers. Determine the questions that a user may have that prevent them\nfrom becoming a customer.\n\nMarketing: The members of your marketing team, and more speci cally the members of\nyour social media marketing team, will have insights regarding the reasons individuals\nreach out to you via social channels. These questions are extremely important for the\nchatbots you use on social media.\nQuora is a website where users can go to ask questions about anything, including your\ncompany. Users can go to Quora to ask questions. Check to see if there are any\nquestions that pertain to your brand. If you notice any patterns in the kinds of questions\npeople are asking, you might want to think about incorporating those into your chatbot.\nIf you want to have a more marketing-focused experience and choose to be more\ncreative, you should evaluate what existing content you already have and determine\nwhich of those pieces of content best supports your objective before you start creating new content.\n\n\n4. Craft Your Bot\u2019s Voice & Personality\nBring in your creative team right away if you haven't done so already; the time is now.\nHumanizing the experience and better aligning the chatbot with your brand are both\nbene ts that come from giving your bot a personality.\n\nMany companies decide to give their automated customer service assistant a name so\nthat they can make it clear to customers that they are interacting with a computer\nprogram. Because of this, they have the opportunity to be open and honest with their\nclients while also maintaining a cordial demeanor.\nBe sure to include copywriting teams in the process so that you can establish crystal clear\nguidelines and a voice that is consistent for your chatbot.\nCollect as much information as you can about your target audience, and then use that\ninformation to direct the questions you ask in the third step.\n\n5. Start Mapping Customer Journeys\nAfter you have asked the initial set of questions, you can then begin to sketch out what\nthe path of the conversation might look like. You can accomplish this goal by beginning in\nGoogle Drawings with the construction of paths using shapes and arrows.\n6. Find the Best Possible Responses\n\nDetermine the most appropriate responses that users can select for each of the questions\nthat you have posed. You should provide the user with multiple response options for each\nquestion that they ask in order to increase the likelihood of successfully meeting their\nrequirements.\n7. Build Out All Conversation Trees\n\nYou must now continue to build out the conversation with each question that you ask and\neach response that is presented to the user as options to choose from. There are some\nconversations that can be concluded with a single question, while there are other\nconversations that can span multiple levels.\nInvest some time in ensuring that every conversation fully satis es the requirements of the\ncustomer. It is possible that it is time to transfer that user to a live representative when the\nconversation has progressed to the point where there are several layers of depth.\n8. Add Some Visual Components\n\nEven if it's just a simple \"hello,\" adding emojis, images, or animated GIFs to the\nconversation you're having with your chatbot can help you create more compelling messages.\nNot only does the use of media lend your messages a greater sense of personality, but it\nalso assists in reinforcing the messages you send and increases the rate at which\nconversations convert into sales.\n9. Guide Customers to Checkout Using Call-To-Action Buttons\n\nWhen a user has provided responses to all of your questions and is prepared to proceed,\nthe call to action is the climactic moment of the interaction with the chatbot. Your call to\naction is a button that you can add to the conversation that is being had by your chatbot\nin order to direct users to a particular objective.\nYou can direct customers to a particular product category or page on your website,\n\nencourage them to share their experience with a friend on social media, or take them\nstraight to the checkout page by utilizing call-to-action buttons. By directing users to the\nlocation of their choice, your bot has the potential to become one of your most valuable\nconversion tools.\nConsider very carefully the destination that you want your customers to reach. This is\nsigni cant because the interaction with your brand may result in high-value conversions at\nscale, without the need for any assistance from a human salesperson.\n\n10. Test Your Conversations\nAs you can see, chatbot journeys have the potential to rapidly evolve into intricate\nconversation maps. Be sure to test each and every possible interaction in order to ensure\nthat all of your users are able to successfully locate the information they seek and do not\nbecome confused or frustrated as a result of using your product.\nThe majority of chatbot platforms come equipped with a live preview feature, which\nallows you to test out all of your ows before actually putting your bot into production.\n\n11. Push Live & Monitor\nWhen you have nished all of the steps that have been outlined above, you are prepared\nto make your rst chatbot live. Just remember to keep an eye on users as they interact\nwith your bots to make sure there aren't any loopholes in the journeys or places where\npeople tend to get stuck on a regular basis.\nIf you follow these 11 steps, you will be well on your way to creating a chatbot\nexperience that will be loved by your customers.\n\n14 BEST AI CHATBOTS SOFTWARE FOR BEGINNERS\n\n1.

{"prompt": "This is part 6 of my multiple messages. I will continue to send you further messages. If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\". \n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 claim for delay damages\n\nWork commenced on 4 September 2017. Consequently, absent any extensions, it ought to have been completed by 5 March 2018, whereas work under the Contract was completed in October 2018, approximately seven months late. It is common ground that the Builder made no applications for extensions of time in accordance with the Contract.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 claim for delay has two components. First, they claim the sum of $370,000, which is said to be the diminution in the value of the property between the time it ought to have been completed (that is, 26 weeks from the date it commenced work) and the time it was in fact completed. Second, they claim general damages for delay and submit that an appropriate figure would be $30,000.\n\nIn response to both claims, the Builder contends that the plaintiffs are only entitled to recover $1 per day, in accordance with the contractual provisions relating to liquidated damages. It submits that by making provision for liquidated damages the parties are to be taken to have intended to exclude a right to general damages, relying on cases such as Alstom Ltd v Yokogawa Australia Pty Ltd (No 7) [2012] SASC 49 at [241]; Pigott Foundations Ltd v Shepherd Construction Ltd (1994) 67 BLR 48 at 65-8 and J-Corp Pty Ltd v Mladenis [2009] WASCA 157 at [35] per Newnes JA. To those may be added the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Temloc Ltd v Errill Properties Ltd (1987) 39 BLR 30. Those cases establish that, generally, where parties choose to make provision for the payment of liquidated damages they are to be taken as excluding a right to claim general damages. The whole point of a clause providing for the payment of liquidated damages is to avoid the expense and time in quantifying the actual damages flowing from a breach of contract arising from delay in completing the work. That purpose would be seriously undermined if the liquidated damages clause was not interpreted as setting out exclusively the damages that could be recovered for delay.\n\nAccepting that principle, the question remains whether by inserting a nominal amount as the amount payable by way of liquidated damages the parties intended, in effect, to exclude the operation of the liquidated damages clause or whether they intended to exclude a right to claim damages for delay altogether. The answer to that question does not depend on the application of any general principle but on the proper construction of the contract in question.\n\nThe plaintiffs make two responses to the Builder\u2019s reliance on the liquidated damages clause. First, they submit that, on the proper construction of the Contract, the liquidated damages clause does not provide an exclusive remedy. Second, they submit that if it does, then it is rendered void by s 18G of the HBA.\n\nThe question whether the liquidated damages clause provides an exclusive remedy for delay and the question whether, if it does, it is void under s 18G of the HBA were not raised by the Amended List Statement or List Response. However, both issues were addressed in the written submissions without objection. Consequently, it is appropriate to deal with them.\n\nThe two questions are tied together. If two interpretations of the liquidated damages clause are available and on one the clause is rendered void by s 18G of the HBA, that is a reason for preferring the alternative interpretation: see Wentworth Shire Council v Bemax Resources Ltd (2013) 278 FLR 264, [2013] NSWSC 1047 at [50] citing Lancashire County Council v Municipal Mutual Insurance Ltd [1997] QB 897 at 906D. That principle has particular application in the present case. The Contract is based on a standard form that has been specifically drafted for use in relation to residential building work in New South Wales and with the HBA and s 18B, in particular, in mind. The standard form contract itself provides that, if the parties do not insert an amount for liquidated damages, then they are to be taken to have inserted the figure of $1 per day. It should not readily be inferred that the drafters of the standard form contract intended to adopt a default position that rendered the provision relating to liquidated damages void. And it should not readily be inferred that the parties to the Contract by making the default position express in their contract intended to achieve a different result from the default position.\n\nSection 18B(1)(d) implies into the Contract a warranty that the work will be completed within the time stipulated in the Contract. In my opinion, a provision of a contract which limits a party to claiming nominal damages for a breach of that warranty has the effect of restricting the rights of that person in respect of such a warranty since it substitutes for a substantial right for its breach a nominal one. It is therefore void under s 18G.\n\nIt follows from what I have said that the better interpretation of the liquidated damages clause is the one that avoids that consequence. On that interpretation, the liquidated damages clause in this case should not be interpreted as providing an exclusive remedy for delay. Rather, by specifying the amount of liquidated damages at $1 per working day, the parties intended not to provide for a substantive right to claim liquidated damages and intended instead to leave the plaintiffs a right to claim damages they could prove they had actually suffered. The position, of course, may well be different if the clause had provided for the payment of a substantial amount by way of liquidated damages.\n\nIn my opinion, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for diminution in the value of their property is nonetheless misconceived. That case as put in Mr Cappello\u2019s affidavit evidence was that on 18 January 2019 a proposed acquisition notice was given by Roads and Maritime Services of the compulsory acquisition without compensation of the substratum of their house for the purpose of constructing a tunnel and roadway as part of the WestConnex project. Mr Cappello says that for several months before the notice was given, Roads and Maritime Services had posted maps showing the location of the proposed tunnel and that after the publication of those maps \u201cselling our house became more difficult\u201d. He says that if the work had been completed by March 2018 \u201cour house could have been sold by June 2018 and we could have avoided most of the drop in the market and the loss caused by the compulsory acquisition \u2026\u201d. In support of that case, the plaintiffs served an expert report from Mr Vincent Romeo, a valuer, who expresses the opinion that the current market value of the property \u201cInclusive of tunnel affectation\u201d is $2,850,000 and \u201cExclusive of tunnel affectation\u201d is $3,220,000. That report appears to have been prepared for the purpose of a claim for compensation under Part 3, Division 4 of the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991 (NSW), since the conclusion of the report is that the plaintiffs are entitled to compensation of $370,000 under the provisions of that Act.\n\nThere are a number of difficulties with this claim.\n\nFirst, it is difficult to see that Mr and Mrs Capello have suffered any loss. That is so for at least two reasons. One is that they have not sold the property. Any loss they may suffer has not been crystallised and may be eliminated by future movements in the market. The other is that if there has been a diminution in the value of their property, they are entitled to recover the amount of that diminution in accordance with the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991 (NSW).\n\nSecond, Mr and Mrs Cappello would only be entitled to claim any diminution in the value of their property from the Builder if the loss they suffered was not too remote a consequence of the Builder\u2019s delay. The test of remoteness is normally stated in terms reflecting the test adopted by the Court of Exchequer in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341 at 354; (1854) 156 ER 145 at 151, which requires either that the loss arise \u201cnaturally, ie, according to the usual course of things\u201d from the breach or that it \u201cmay reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it\u201d.\n\nApplying that test, the loss is plainly too remote. It was not a natural consequence of the delay. Nor was it in the contemplation of the parties at the time they signed the Contract. Mr Cappello does not contend that the risk of acquisition was present at the time they signed the Contract. Despite suggestions by Mr Cappello to the contrary, it is plain that the house was being renovated with the intention that he and his family would continue to live in it after the renovations were completed. That is evidenced by the detailed consideration both he and his wife gave to particular aspects of the renovation and the frequent suggestions they made for improvements. One example is an email Mr Cappello sent to Mr Re on 28 March 2017 in which he says that he was not sure what he wanted in the kitchen, made some suggestions and concluded \u201cI am sure that you will have some great suggestions as I have been waiting a long while for this kitchen!\u2019\u201d. Another example is a text message Mr Cappello sent Mr Re on 17 December 2017 saying that he and his wife \u201chave a slight dilemma as rethinking about the fireplace\u201d and asking for its installation to be postponed until the following year. These are not the sentiments of someone keen to see the work completed as quickly as possible so that the property could be sold. And despite statements in his affidavit evidence to the contrary, Mr Cappello accepted in cross-examination that he never told the Builder that he intended to sell the property once the renovations were completed.\n\nThe plaintiffs submit that no test of remoteness applies in this case because their claim is based on s 18B of the HBA, not on contract. I do not accept that submission. Section 18B implies certain warranties into the Contract. Breach of those warranties is a breach of contract. Therefore, the normal principles applicable to breach of contract apply.\n\nThird, and in any event, I am not satisfied that the acquisition of the substratum below the house has brought about a diminution in its value. It is not clear from Mr Romeo\u2019s report how he has reached the conclusion that the acquisition of the substratum will decrease the value of the property by $370,000. He refers to \u201c[n]egative buyer sentiment relative to surrounding subterranean tunnel infrastructure\u201d and quotes a number of real estate agents who have expressed that sentiment. However, he makes no attempt to compare actual sales both before and after the location of the tunnel was announced of properties affected by the tunnel and those that are not. Nor, for example, does he attempt to compare the effect on prices of properties above other tunnels. Without a comparison of that type, it is not possible to say whether any diminution in values is a result of the tunnel or of other factors. Moreover, he says elsewhere in his report:\n\nWe note the WestConnex development to increase negative buyer sentiment during the construction phase, however, once complete, the WestConnex development is considered to bring positive sentiment due to the close proximity to upgraded road and rail infrastructure.\n\nThat suggests that any diminution in value is at most temporary. Finally, the evidence given by Mr Romeo is contradicted by expert valuation evidence given by Mr David Bird. Mr Bird is critical of Mr Romeo\u2019s report because Mr Romeo has failed to identify any market evidence that would support his conclusion about the effect of the tunnel on prices. I accept that criticism.\n\nIn certain circumstances, courts will award damages for physical inconvenience resulting from a breach of contract: see, J D Heydon, Heydon on Contract, Law Book Co, 2019, citing Hobbs v London and South Western Railway Co (1875) LR 10 QB 111 at 122. In this case, the plaintiffs continued to live on the first floor of their home during the renovations. The evidence of the inconvenience is scant. Mr Cappello says that he, his wife and son had to live on the first floor, that they could not park their cars in the garage or driveway or have access to the rear garden and that they had to live with dust and noise. But it is not possible to say from the evidence how significant those inconveniences were. Elsewhere, Mr Cappello says that both he and his wife work full time. The likelihood is that most of the work was undertaken when they were not present. Moreover, although the Builder did not make any formal applications for extensions of time, it is apparent that Mr and Mrs Cappello were responsible for a substantial part of the delay because of changes they requested or wanted to consider. Taking those matters into account, I do not think that this is an appropriate case for the award of general damages.\n\nIt follows that the plaintiffs are only entitled to claim $1 per day as damages for delay in completion of the building work. Assuming that work was completed on 11 October 2018, that amount is $152.\n\nPlease write in English language.", "length": 3194}

After confirmation, please wait for the next chunk.\n=== SCRIPT CHUNK 1/3 ===\n- JUMPING MONKEY HILL\n \n The cabins all had thatch roofs. Names like Baboon Lodge and Porcupine Place were handpainted beside the wooden doors that led out to cobblestone paths, and the windows were left open so that guests woke up to the rustling of the jacaranda leaves and the steady calming crash of the sea\u2019s waves. The wicker trays held a selection of fine teas. At midmorning, discreet black maids made the bed, cleaned the elegant bathtub, vacuumed the carpet, and left wildflowers in handcrafted vases. Ujunwa found it odd that the African Writers Workshop was held here, at Jumping Monkey Hill, outside Cape Town. The name itself was incongruous, and the resort had the complacence of the well-fed about it, the kind of place where she imagined affluent foreign tourists would dart around taking pictures of lizards and then return home still mostly unaware that there were more black people than red-capped lizards in South Africa. Later, she would learn that Edward Campbell had chosen the resort; he had spent weekends there when he was a lecturer at the University of Cape Town years ago. But she didn\u2019t know this the afternoon Edward\u2014an old man in a summer hat who smiled to show two front teeth the color of mildew\u2014picked her up at the airport. He kissed her on both cheeks. He asked if she had had any trouble with her prepaid ticket in Lagos, if she minded waiting for the Ugandan whose flight would come soon, if she was hungry. He told her that his wife, Isabel, had already picked up most of the other workshop participants and that their friends Simon and Hermione, who had come with them from London as paid staff, were arranging a welcome lunch back at the resort. He and Ujunwa sat down on a bench in Arrivals. He balanced the sign with the Ugandan\u2019s name on his shoulder and told her how humid Cape Town was at this time of the year, how pleased he was about the workshop arrangements. He lengthened his words. His accent was what the British called \u201cposh,\u201d the kind some rich Nigerians tried to mimic and ended up sounding unintentionally funny. Ujunwa wondered if he was the one who had selected her for the workshop. Probably not; it was the British Council that had made the call for entries and then selected the best. Edward had moved a little and sat closer to her. He was asking what she did back home in Nigeria. Ujunwa faked a wide yawn and hoped he would stop talking. He repeated his question and asked whether she had taken leave from her job to attend the workshop. He was watching her intently. He could have been anything from sixty-five to ninety. She could not tell his age from his face; it was pleasant but unformed, as though God, having created him, had slapped him flat against a wall and smeared his features all over his face. She smiled vaguely and said that she had lost her job just before she left Lagos\u2014a job in banking\u2014and so there had been no need to take leave. She yawned again. He seemed keen to know more and she did not want to say more, and so when she looked up and saw the Ugandan walking toward them, she was relieved. The Ugandan looked sleepy. He was in his early thirties, square-faced and dark-skinned, with uncombed hair that had tightened into kinky balls. He bowed as he shook Edward\u2019s hand with both of his and then turned and mumbled a hello to Ujunwa. He sat in the front seat of the Renault. The drive to the resort was long, on roads haphazardly chiseled into steep hills, and Ujunwa worried that Edward was too old to drive so fast. She held her breath until they arrived at the cluster of thatch roofs and manicured paths. A smiling blond woman showed her to her cabin, Zebra Lair, which had a four-poster bed and linen that smelled of lavender. Ujunwa sat on the bed for a moment and then got up to unpack, looking out of the window from time to time to search the canopy of trees for lurking monkeys. There were none, unfortunately, Edward told the participants later, as they ate lunch under pink umbrellas on the terrace, their tables pushed close to the railing so that they could look down at the turquoise sea. He pointed at each person and did the introductions. The white South African woman was from Durban, while the black man came from Johannesburg. The Tanzanian man came fromArusha, the Ugandan man from Entebbe, the Zimbabwean woman from Bulawayo, the Kenyan man from Nairobi, and the Senegalese woman, the youngest at twenty-three, had flown in from Paris, where she attended university. Edward introduced Ujunwa last: \u201cUjunwa Ogundu is our Nigerian participant and she lives in Lagos.\u201d Ujunwa looked around the table and wondered with whom she would get along. The Senegalese woman was the most promising, with the irreverent sparkle in her eyes and the Francophone accent and the streaks of silver in her fat dreadlocks. The Zimbabwean woman had longer, thinner dreadlocks, and the cowries in them clinked as she moved her head from side to side. She seemed hyper, overactive, and Ujunwa thought she might like her, but only the way she liked alcohol\u2014in small amounts. The Kenyan and the Tanzanian looked ordinary, almost indistinguishable\u2014tall men with wide foreheads who were wearing tattered beards and shortsleeved patterned shirts. She thought she would like them in the uninvested way that one likes nonthreatening people. She wasn\u2019t sure about the South Africans: the white woman had a tooearnest face, humorless and free of makeup, and the black man looked patiently pious, like a Jehovah\u2019s Witness who went from door to door and smiled when each was shut in his face. As for the Ugandan, Ujunwa had disliked him from the airport, and did so even more now because of his toadying answers to Edward\u2019s questions, the way he leaned forward to speak only to Edward and ignored the other participants. They, in turn, said little to him. They all knew he was the winner of the last Lipton African Writers\u2019 Prize, with an award of fifteen thousand pounds. They didn\u2019t include him in the polite talk about their flights. After they ate the creamy chicken prettied with herbs, after they drank the sparkling water that came in glossy bottles, Edward stood up to give the welcoming address. He squinted as he spoke, and his thin hair fluttered in the breeze that smelled of the sea. He started by telling them what they already knew\u2014that the workshop would be for two weeks; that it was his idea but of course funded graciously by the Chamberlain Arts Foundation, just as the Lipton African Writers\u2019 Prize had been his idea and funded also by the good people at the foundation; that they were all expected to produce one story for possible publication in the Oratory; that laptops would be provided in the cabins; that they would write during the first week and review each participant\u2019s work during the second week; and that the Ugandan would be workshop leader. Then he talked about himself, how African literature had been his cause for forty years, a lifelong passion that started at Oxford. He glanced often at the Ugandan. The Ugandan nodded eagerly to acknowledge each glance. Finally Edward introduced his wife, Isabel, although they had all met her. He told them she was an animal rights activist, an old Africa hand who had spent her teenage years in Botswana. He looked proud when she stood up, as if her tall and lean gracefulness made up for what he lacked in appearance. Her hair was a muted red, cut so that wisps framed her face. She patted it as she said, \u201cEdward, really, an introduction.\u201d Ujunwa imagined, though, that Isabel had wanted that introduction, that perhaps she had even reminded Edward of it, saying, Now, dear, remember to introduce me properly at lunch. Her tone would have been delicate. The next day at breakfast, Isabel used just such a tone when she sat next to Ujunwa and said that surely, with that exquisite bone structure, Ujunwa had to come from Nigerian royal stock. The first thing that came to Ujunwa\u2019s mind was to ask if Isabel ever needed royal blood to explain the good looks of friends back in London. She did not ask that but instead said\u2014because she could not resist \u2014that she was indeed a princess and came from an ancient lineage and that one of her forebears had captured a Portuguese trader in the seventeenth century and kept him, pampered and oiled, in a royal cage. She stopped to sip her cranberry juice and smile into her glass. Isabel said, brightly, that she could always spot royal blood and she hoped Ujunwa would support her antipoaching campaign and it was just horrible, horrible, how many endangered apes people were killing and they didn\u2019t even eat them, never mind all that talk about bush meat, they just used the private parts for charms. After breakfast, Ujunwa called her mother and told her about the resort and about Isabel and was pleased when her mother chuckled. She hung up and sat in front of her laptop and thought about how long it had been since her mother had really laughed. She sat there for a long time, moving the mouse from side to side, trying to decide whether to name her character something common, like Chioma, or something exotic, like Ibari. Chioma lives with her mother in Lagos. She has a degree in economics from Nsukka, has recently finished her National Youth Service, and every Thursday she buys The Guardian and scours the employment section and sends out her CV in brown manila envelopes. She hears nothing for weeks. Finally she gets a phone call inviting her to an interview. After the first few questions, the man says he will hire her and then walks across and stands behind her and reaches over her shoulders to squeeze her breasts. She hisses, \u201cStupid man! You cannot respect yourself!\u201d and leaves. Weeks of silence follow. She helps out at her mother\u2019s boutique. She sends out more envelopes. At the next interview, the woman, speaking in the fakest, silliest accent Chioma has ever heard, tells her she wants somebody foreign-educated, and Chioma almost laughs as she leaves. More weeks of silence. Chioma has not seen her father in months, but she decides to go to his new office in Victoria Island to ask if he can help her find a job. Their meeting is tense. \u201cWhy have you not come since, eh?\u201d he asks, pretending to be angry, because she knows it is easier for him to be angry, it is easier to be angry with people after you have hurt them. He makes some calls. He gives her a thin roll of twohundred-naira notes. He does not ask about her mother. She notices that the Yellow Woman\u2019s photo is on his desk. Her mother had described her well: \u201cShe is very fair, she looks mixed, and the thing is that she is not even pretty, she has a face like an overripe yellow pawpaw.\u201d The chandelier in the main dining room of Jumping Monkey Hill hung so low that Ujunwa could extend her hand and touch it. Edward sat at one end of the long, white-covered table, Isabel at the other, and the participants in between. The hardwood floors thumped noisily as waiters walked around and handed out menus. Ostrich medallions. Smoked salmon. Chicken in orange sauce. Edward urged everyone to eat the ostrich. It was simply mah-ve-lous. Ujunwa did not like the idea of eating an ostrich, did not even know that people ate ostriches, and when she said so, Edward laughed good-naturedly and said that of course ostrich was an African staple. Everyone else ordered the ostrich, and when Ujunwa\u2019s chicken, too citrusy, came, she wondered if perhaps she should have had the ostrich. It looked like beef, anyway. She drank more alcohol than she had ever drunk in her life, two glasses of wine, and she felt mellowed and chatted with the Senegalese about the best ways to care for natural black hair: no silicone products, lots of shea butter, combing only when wet. She overheard snatches as Edward talked about wine: Chardonnay was horribly boring. Afterwards, the participants gathered in the gazebo\u2014except for the Ugandan, who sat away with Edward and Isabel. They slapped at flying insects and drank wine and laughed and teased one another: You Kenyans are too submissive! You Nigerians are too aggressive! You Tanzanians have no fashion sense! You Senegalese are too brainwashed by the French! They talked about the war in the Sudan, about the decline of the African Writers Series, about books and writers. They agreed that Dambudzo Marechera was astonishing, that Alan Paton was patronizing, that Isak Dinesen was unforgivable. The Kenyan put on a generic European accent and, between drags at his cigarette, recited what Isak Dinesen had said about all Kikuyu children becoming mentally retarded at the age of nine. They laughed. The Zimbabwean said Achebe was boring and did nothing with style, and the Kenyan said that was a sacrilege and snatched at the Zimbabwean\u2019s wineglass, until she recanted, laughing, saying of course Achebe was sublime.

Ujunwa began to jump up and down, babbling nonsense to mimic Conrad\u2019s Africans, feeling the sweet lightness of wine in her head. The Zimbabwean staggered and fell into the water fountain and climbed out spluttering, her dreadlocks wet, saying she had felt some fish wriggling around in there. The Kenyan said he would use that for his story\u2014 fish in the fancy resort fountain\u2014since he really had no idea what he was going to write about. The Senegalese said her story was really her story, about how she mourned her girlfriend and how her grieving had emboldened her to come out to her parents although they now treated her being a lesbian as a mild joke and continued to speak of the families of suitable young men. The black South African looked alarmed when he heard \u201clesbian.\u201d He got up and walked away. The Kenyan said the black South African reminded him of his father, who attended a Holy Spirit Revival church and didn\u2019t speak to people on the street because they were not saved. The Zimbabwean, Tanzanian, white South African, and Senegalese all spoke about their fathers. They looked at Ujunwa and she realized that she was the only one who had said nothing, and for a moment the wine no longer fogged her mind. She shrugged and mumbled that there was really little to say about her father. He was a normal person. \u201cIs he in your life?\u201d the Senegalese asked, with the soft tone that meant she assumed he was not, and for the first time her Francophone accent irritated Ujunwa. \u201cHe is in my life,\u201d Ujunwa said with a quiet force. \u201cHe was the one who bought me books when I was a child and the one who read my early poems and stories.\u201d She paused, and everyone was looking at her and she added, \u201cHe did something that surprised me. It hurt me, too, but mostly it surprised me.\u201d The Senegalese looked as if she wanted to ask more but changed her mind and said she wanted more wine. \u201cAre you writing about your father?\u201d the Kenyan asked and Ujunwa answered with an emphatic NO because she had never believed in fiction as therapy. The Tanzanian told her that all fiction was therapy, some sort of therapy, no matter what anybody said. That evening, Ujunwa tried to write, but her eyeballs were swimming and her head was aching and so she went to bed. After breakfast, she sat before the laptop and cradled a cup of tea. Chioma gets a call from Merchant Trust bank, one of the places her father contacted. He knows the chairman of the board. She is hopeful; all the bank people she knows drive nice secondhand Jettas and have nice flats in Gbagada. The deputy manager interviews her. He is dark and good-looking and his glasses have an elegant designer logo on the frames and, as he speaks to her, she desperately wishes he would notice her. He doesn\u2019t. He tells her that they would like to hire her to do marketing, which will mean going out and bringing in new accounts. She will be working with Yinka. If she can bring in ten million naira during her trial period, she will be guaranteed a permanent position. She nods as he speaks. She is used to men\u2019s attention and is sulky that he does not look at her as a man looks at a woman, and she does not quite understand what he means by going out to get new accounts until she starts the job two weeks later. A uniformed driver takes her and Yinka in an air-conditioned official Jeep\u2014she runs her hand over the smooth leather seat, is reluctant to climb out\u2014to the home of an alhaji in Ikoyi. The alhaji is avuncular and expansive with his smile, his hand gestures, his laughter. Yinka has already come to see him a few times before and he hugs her and says something that makes her laugh. He looks at Chioma. \u201cThis one is too fine,\u201d he says. A steward serves frosted glasses of chapman. The alhaji speaks to Yinka but looks often at Chioma. Then he asks Yinka to come closer and explain the high-interest savings accounts to him and then he asks her to sit on his lap and doesn\u2019t she think he\u2019s strong enough to carry her? Yinka says of course he is and sits on his lap, smiling a serene smile. Yinka is small and fair; she reminds Chioma of the Yellow Woman. What Chioma knows of the Yellow Woman is what her mother told her. One slow afternoon, the Yellow Woman had walked into her mother\u2019s boutique on Adeniran Ogunsanya Street. Her mother knew who the Yellow Woman was, knew the relationship with her husband had been on for a year, knew that he had paid for the Yellow Woman\u2019s Honda Accord and her flat in Ilupeju. But what drove her mother crazy was the insult of this: the Yellow Woman coming to her boutique, looking at shoes and planning to pay for them with money that really belonged to her husband. So her mother yanked at the Yellow Woman\u2019s weave-on that hung to her back and screamed \u201cHusband snatcher!\u201d and the salesgirls joined in, slapping and beating the Yellow Woman until she ran out to her car. When Chioma\u2019s father heard of it, he shouted at her mother and said she had acted like one of those wild women from the street, had disgraced him, herself, and an innocent woman for nothing. Then he left the house. Chioma came back from National Youth Service and noticed that her father\u2019s wardrobe was empty. Aunty Elohor, Aunty Rose, and Aunty Uche had all come and said to her mother, \u201cWe are prepared to go with you and beg him to come back home or we will go and beg on your behalf.\u201d Chioma\u2019s mother said, \u201cNever, not in this world. I am not going to beg him. It is enough.\u201d Aunty Funmi came and said the Yellow Woman had tied him up with medicine and she knew a good babalawo who could untie him. Chioma\u2019s mother said, \u201cNo, I am not going.\u201d Her boutique was failing, because Chioma\u2019s father had always helped her import shoes from Dubai. So she lowered prices, advertised in Joy and City People, and started stocking shoes made in Aba. Chioma is wearing a pair of those shoes the morning she sits in the alhaji\u2019s sitting room and watches Yinka, perched on the expansive lap, talking about the benefits of a savings account with Merchant Trust Bank. . . . At first, Ujunwa tried not to notice that Edward often stared at her body, that his eyes were never on her face but always lower. The workshop days had taken on a routine of breakfast at eight and lunch at one and dinner at six in the grand dining room. On the sixth day, a blisteringly hot day, Edward handed out copies of the first story to be reviewed, written by the Zimbabwean. The participants were all seated on the terrace, and after he handed out the papers, Ujunwa saw that all the seats under the umbrellas were occupied. \u201cI don\u2019t mind sitting in the sun,\u201d she said, already getting up. \u201cWould you like me to stand up for you, Edward?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather like you to lie down for me,\u201d he said. The moment was humid, thick; a bird cawed from far away. Edward was grinning. Only the Ugandan and the Tanzanian had heard him. Then the Ugandan laughed. And Ujunwa laughed, because it was funny and witty, she told herself, when you really thought about it. After lunch, she took a walk with the Zimbabwean and as they stopped to pick up shells by the sea, Ujunwa wanted to tell her what Edward had said. But the Zimbabwean seemed distracted, less chatty than usual; she was probably anxious about her story. Ujunwa read it that evening. She thought the writing had too many flourishes, but she liked the story and wrote appreciations and careful suggestions in the margins. It was familiar and funny, about a Harare secondary schoolteacher whose Pentecostal minister tells him that he and his wife will not have a child until they get a confession from the witches who have tied up his wife\u2019s womb. They become convinced that the witches are their next-door neighbors, and every morning they pray loudly, throwing verbal Holy Ghost bombs over the fence. After the Zimbabwean read an excerpt the next day, there was a short silence around the dining table. Then the Ugandan spoke and said there was much energy in the prose. The white South African nodded enthusiastically. The Kenyan disagreed. Some of the sentences tried so hard to be literary that they didn\u2019t make sense, he said, and he read one such sentence. The Tanzanian man said a story had to be looked at as a whole and not in parts. Yes, the Kenyan agreed, but each part had to make sense in order to form a whole that made sense. Then Edward spoke. The writing was certainly ambitious, but the story itself begged the question \u201cSo what?\u201d There was something terribly pass\u00e9 about it when one considered all the other things happening in Zimbabwe under the horrible Mugabe. Ujunwa stared at Edward. What did he mean by \u201cpass\u00e9\u201d? How could a story so true be pass\u00e9? But she did not ask what Edward meant and the Kenyan did not ask and the Ugandan did not ask and all the Zimbabwean did was shove her dreadlocks away from her face, cowries clinking. Everyone else remained silent. Soon they all began to yawn and say good night and walk to their cabins. The next day, they did not talk about the previous evening. They talked about how fluffy the scrambled eggs were and how eerie the jacaranda leaves that rustled against their windows at night were. After dinner, the Senegalese read from her story. It was a windy night and they shut the door to keep out the sound of the whirling trees. The smoke from Edward\u2019s pipe hung over the room. The Senegalese read two pages of a funeral scene, stopping often to sip some water, her accent thickening as she became more emotional, each t sounding like a z. Afterwards, everyone turned to Edward, even the Ugandan, who seemed to have forgotten that he was workshop leader. Edward chewed at his pipe thoughtfully before he said that homosexual stories of this sort weren\u2019t reflective of Africa, really. \u201cWhich Africa?\u201d Ujunwa blurted out. The black South African shifted on his seat. Edward chewed further at his pipe. Then he looked at Ujunwa in the way one would look at a child who refused to keep still in church and said that he wasn\u2019t speaking as an Oxford-trained Africanist, but as one who was keen on the real Africa and not the imposing of Western ideas on African venues. The Zimbabwean and Tanzanian and white South African began to shake their heads as Edward was speaking. \u201cThis may indeed be the year 2000, but how African is it for a person to tell her family that she is homosexual?\u201d Edward asked. The Senegalese burst out in incomprehensible French and then, a minute of fluid speech later, said, \u201cI am Senegalese! I am Senegalese!\u201d Edward responded in equally swift French and then said in English, with a soft smile, \u201cI think she had too much of that excellent Bordeaux,\u201d and some of the participants chuckled. Ujunwa was the first to leave. She was close to her cabin when she heard somebody call her and she stopped. It was the Kenyan. The Zimbabwean and the white South African were with him. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the bar,\u201d the Kenyan said. She wondered where the Senegalese was. In the bar, she drank a glass of wine and listened to them talk about how the other guests at Jumping Monkey Hill \u2014all of whom were white\u2014looked at the participants suspiciously. The Kenyan said a youngish couple had stopped and stepped back a little as he approached them on the path from the swimming pool the day before. The white South African said she got suspicious looks, too, perhaps because she wore only kente-print caftans. Sitting there, staring out into the black night, listening to the drink-softened voices around her, Ujunwa felt a self-loathing burst open in the bottom of her stomach. She should not have laughed when Edward said \u201cI\u2019d rather like you to lie down for me.\u201d It had not been funny. It had not been funny at all. She had hated it, hated the grin on his face and the glimpse of greenish teeth and the way he always looked at her chest rather than her face, the way his eyes climbed all over her, and yet she had made herself laugh like a deranged hyena. She put down her half-finished glass of wine and said, \u201cEdward is always looking at my body.\u201d The Kenyan and the white South African and Zimbabwean stared at her. Ujunwa repeated, \u201cEdward is always looking at my body.\u201d The Kenyan said it was clear from the first day that the man would be climbing on top of that flat stick of a wife and\n=== END OF CHUNK ===", "length": 3246}

{"prompt": "hi bot, do you know what kinesiotaping is?\nYes, I'm familiar with kinesiotaping. It's a type of physical therapy that uses elastic tape to support and stabilize muscles and joints. The tape is applied in specific patterns to help with muscle alignment and balance, and to promote blood flow and healing. It's often used to treat injuries and chronic conditions, such as back pain, knee pain, and tendonitis.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nokay, so listen. My friend is a stomatologist and he does research on kinesiotaping in stomatology. What he does is he takes out wisdom teeth of his patients and wants to see if kinesiotaping can make the process of healing faster or less painful. He has 2 groups of patients - those that were kinesiotaped and a control group. As I am a statistician he has asked me with help of analyzing his data to show if his results are significant, coul you help me with choosing a method to do that? \nSure, I'd be happy to help with that. To analyze your friend's data and determine whether kinesiotaping has a significant effect on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal, you can use a statistical test called a hypothesis test. This test will allow you to compare the two groups of patients (the kinesiotaped group and the control group) and determine whether any differences between the groups are likely due to the kinesiotaping, or if they could have occurred by chance.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nany hypothesis test in particular?\nOne common hypothesis test that could be used in this situation is the t-test. This test is used to compare the means (averages) of two groups, and determine whether any differences between the groups are statistically significant. The t-test assumes that the data is normally distributed, so you would need to check for normality in your data before using this test.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nhow do I check if the data is normally distributed?\nTo check whether your data is normally distributed, you can use a statistical test called the Shapiro-Wilk test. This test will determine whether the data is likely to have come from a population with a normal distribution. To perform the test, you would need to calculate the Shapiro-Wilk statistic for your data, and compare it to a critical value from a table of critical values. If the calculated statistic is greater than the critical value, then the data is considered to be normally distributed.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nok and what if the data is not normally distributed?\nIf your data is not normally distributed, then you would need to use a different statistical test to analyze the data. One option in this situation would be to use a nonparametric test, such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or the Mann-Whitney U test. These tests are designed for data that is not normally distributed, and can be used to compare the means of two groups. Like the t-test, these tests will allow you to determine whether any differences between the groups are statistically significant.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nthen why not use these tests also for normally distributed data?\nWhile nonparametric tests can be used with normally distributed data, they are generally less powerful than parametric tests like the t-test. This means that they may be less likely to detect significant differences between the groups, even if those differences exist. So, if your data is normally distributed, it's usually better to use a parametric test like the t-test, because it will provide more accurate and precise results. However, if your data is not normally distributed, then a nonparametric test is the better choice.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nalso my friend has asked me how many patients should be in his data before I can have meaningful tests\nThe number of patients in your data will affect the power of your statistical tests, which is the probability of detecting a real difference between the groups if one exists. In general, the more patients you have in your data, the more powerful your tests will be. This means that you will be more likely to detect a significant difference between the groups if one exists.\n\nHowever, there is no set number of patients that you need in order to have meaningful results. The appropriate sample size will depend on the size of the effect you are trying to detect, the level of precision you need, and the type of test you are using. In some cases, a small sample size may be sufficient, while in other cases, a larger sample size may be needed. It's best to consult with a statistician or other expert to determine the appropriate sample size for your study.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nany rule of thumb on this one? especially if i'm using the t-test\nThere is no set rule for determining the sample size for a t-test, as it will depend on the specific circumstances of your study. However, as a general rule of thumb, you will need at least 30 samples per group in order to have adequate power to detect a significant difference between the groups. This is because the t-test is a parametric test that assumes a normal distribution of the data, and a sample size of 30 is generally considered the minimum required to adequately approximate a normal distribution.\n\nHowever, this is just a general guideline, and the appropriate sample size for your study may be different. It's best to consult with a statistician or other expert to determine the appropriate sample size for your specific study.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nalright comming back to my friend and his research he has also asked me what measurements should he take during the research, could you help with that also?\nTo determine the effectiveness of kinesiotaping on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal, your friend will need to measure certain outcomes or variables. These could include the amount of pain experienced by the patients, the time it takes for the patients to heal, and any complications that occur during the healing process. Your friend will also need to measure the same variables for both the kinesiotaped group and the control group, in order to compare the two groups and determine whether the kinesiotaping had any effect.\n\nIt's important to choose the right variables to measure, because these will determine the results of the study. Your friend will need to consider which outcomes are most important to evaluate, and how to measure them accurately and reliably. He may also need to consider any potential confounding factors that could affect the results, and how to control for these in the study design. A statistician or other expert can help your friend choose the right variables and design the study in the most effective way.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\none thing he has chosen to measure is jaw circumference, do you think it is a smart thing to measure?\nMeasuring jaw circumference could potentially be a useful way to evaluate the effectiveness of kinesiotaping on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal. The jaw circumference is related to swelling in the area, and swelling can be a common issue after wisdom tooth removal. By measuring the jaw circumference, your friend could potentially determine whether kinesiotaping helps to reduce swelling and improve the healing process.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider whether this is the most important outcome to measure, and whether it can be measured accurately and reliably. Measuring jaw circumference could be difficult, and it's possible that other outcomes, such as pain levels or the time it takes for the patients to heal, may be more important to evaluate. It's best to consult with a statistician or other expert to determine the most appropriate variables to measure in your friend's study.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nhow do you define \"time it takes for the patients to heal\" especially how does he know when the patient has healed already?\nIn this context, \"time it takes for the patients to heal\" refers to the amount of time that elapses between the wisdom tooth removal surgery and the point at which the patient has fully recovered from the surgery. This could be measured in a number of ways, such as by tracking the length of time until the patient no longer experiences any pain or discomfort, or until the incision site has fully healed.\n\nDetermining when a patient has fully healed can be somewhat subjective, and it may depend on the specific criteria that your friend establishes for the study. For example, he could define \"fully healed\" as the point at which the patient no longer experiences any pain or discomfort, or when the incision site is no longer visible. He could also use objective measures, such as the results of a physical examination, to determine whether the patient has fully healed. It's important to choose clear and specific criteria for determining when a patient has fully healed, in order to ensure that the results of the study are accurate and reliable.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nand how would you collect the data on \"pain levels\"?\nTo collect data on pain levels, your friend could use a variety of methods, depending on the specific goals of his study. One common method is to use a pain intensity scale, such as a numerical rating scale or a visual analogue scale. These scales allow patients to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, or to indicate their pain level by marking a line on a scale. This allows for a more precise measurement of pain intensity than simply asking patients whether they are experiencing pain.\n\nYour friend could also use other methods to collect data on pain levels, such as by asking patients to keep a daily diary or log of their pain levels, or by conducting regular interviews or surveys to assess pain intensity. The choice of method will depend on the specific goals of the study, as well as the availability of resources and the preferences of the patients. A statistician or other expert can help your friend choose the most appropriate methods for collecting data on pain levels.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nAs of now he has chosen to count how many painkillers each patient has taken each day, do you think it is a good idea?\nCounting the number of painkillers taken by each patient could potentially be a useful way to assess pain levels after wisdom tooth removal. The number of painkillers taken can be an objective measure of pain intensity, and it can provide a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of kinesiotaping on pain management. However, this method has some limitations, and it may not provide a complete picture of the patient's pain levels.\n\nOne potential limitation of this method is that not all patients will experience the same level of pain, and some patients may be more or less sensitive to pain than others. This means that the number of painkillers taken by a patient may not accurately reflect their actual pain levels. Additionally, some patients may choose not to take painkillers, or may not be able to take them due to other medical conditions. This could make it difficult to compare the pain levels of different patients based on the number of painkillers taken.\n\nOverall, counting the number of painkillers taken by each patient could be a useful method for assessing pain levels, but it should not be the only method used. It's important to use a combination of methods to assess pain levels, in order to provide a more complete and accurate picture of the patient's pain experience. A statistician or other expert can help your friend choose the most appropriate methods for collecting data on pain levels.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nokay, I think I know everything from my side. Thanks very much\nYou're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'm here to help.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\nhmm... one thing still bugs me - his research will be published as a paper and he doesn't have an abstract yet\nAn abstract is a brief summary of a research paper that provides an overview of the paper's main points and findings. An abstract should be concise and to the point, and should include the main objectives of the study, the methods used, the results obtained, and the conclusions reached.\n\nTo write an abstract for your friend's research on kinesiotaping and wisdom tooth removal, you can start by summarizing the main objectives of the study. This could include the specific question that the study is trying to answer, such as whether kinesiotaping can help to reduce pain and improve the healing process after wisdom tooth removal. Next, you can briefly describe the methods used in the study, such as the number of patients and the variables measured. You can then summarize the results of the study, such as whether kinesiotaping had a significant effect on the outcomes measured. Finally, you can state the main conclusions of the study, such as whether kinesiotaping is an effective treatment for improving the healing process after wisdom tooth removal.\n\nAn abstract should be no more than a few hundred words, so it's important to be concise and to focus on the most important points of the study. A well-written abstract will provide readers with a clear and concise overview of the study, and will help them to decide whether they want to read the full paper.\n\n\nPatryk Dybczak\ncould you help me with writing abstract for his paper?\nSure, I'd be happy to help with that. Here's an example of an abstract for your friend's research on kinesiotaping and wisdom tooth removal:\n\nThe use of kinesiotaping has been shown to have beneficial effects on muscle alignment and healing, but its effects on the healing process after wisdom tooth removal have not been well studied. In this study, we compared the outcomes of wisdom tooth removal surgery in two groups of patients: one group that received kinesiotaping, and a control group that did not. We measured variables such as pain levels, healing time, and complications, and used statistical tests to determine whether any differences between the groups were statistically significant. Our results showed that kinesiotaping significantly reduced pain levels and improved the healing process after wisdom tooth removal. These findings suggest that kinesiotaping may be an effective treatment for improving the healing process after wisdom tooth removal.\n\nThis abstract provides a brief summary of the main points of the study, including the objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. It also includes key information about the study design and the variables measured, and highlights the main findings of the study. This abstract should give readers a clear understanding of the study, and should help them to decide whether they want to read the full paper.\n\nOf course, this is just an example, and your friend may want to tailor the abstract to fit the specific details of his study. He may also want to consult with a statistician or other expert to ensure that the abstract accurately reflects the findings of the study.", "length": 3315}

{"prompt": "explain in detail the summary of this paper in no less than 1000 words? ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) imposes a major burden on global public health which is exacerbated by the escalating number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. There is consequently an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. We have investigated the natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) for repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Here, we report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. Moreover, the FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCombination therapy is essential to the clinical management of tuberculosis (TB) disease (1). Until recently, strategies to identify and advance promising combinations during early-stage pre-clinical TB drug discovery were limited. However, growing recognition of the need to identify new anti-TB drugs and regimens has re-focused attention on early-stage pre-clinical identification of synergizing combination partners for potential development (2), including drugs which are not clinically effective against TB (3, 4).\n\nAs part of a drug repurposing strategy, we utilized fusidic acid (FA) as anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combination(s) that might be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy. FA, a translational inhibitor with demonstrated (albeit moderate) activity in vitro (5, 6), was selected owing to its unique mechanism of action: specifically, inhibition of mycobacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) (7). The antimicrobial-potentiating effect of FA with other antibiotics including the frontline anti-TB drug, ethambutol (EMB), as well as its lack of cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes, provided additional motivation for our choice of FA (8, 9). In this short report, we present the analysis of in vitro interactions between FA and partner compounds comprising drugs currently used in TB treatment and selected translational inhibitors, the latter selected to enable evaluation the effects of combining FA with drugs acting on the same pathway (Fig. 1), (10, 11).\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nAntibiotic targets in protein synthesis:\nSchematic representation indicating known and predicted target sites of antibiotics disrupting different stages in the (myco)bacterial translation pathway. The tRNA binding sites - amino acid (A), peptide (P), and exit (E) - on the ribosome are indicated. Adopted and modified from Wilson et al. (10).\n\nRESULTS\nCheckerboard assay identifies synergistic drug combination partners for fusidic acid\nTo identify potential partners of FA, our preliminary screens utilized Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, a fast-growing, non-pathogenic mycobacterium which has been exploited as a useful surrogate in drug efficacy studies in vitro. In standard two-drug checkerboard experiments (Table S1), SPC, ERY, CLR and TET exhibited synergy with FA, defined as FICI \u2264 0.5. These combinations displayed a 4-to 16-fold reduction in MIC90 for each of the individual drugs (Fig. S1). No antagonistic effects were observed with any of the combinations tested.\n\nThe synergies detected in M. smegmatis informed subsequent selection of combination partners for evaluation in M. tuberculosis using the checkerboard method. In addition, representative drugs consisting of clinically used anti-TB agents (first- and second-line) and selected translational inhibitors were tested in combination with FA. For these assays, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv reporter strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used, as described previously (12). Fig. S2 provides an example of an interaction study in which FA and ERY were analysed in the checkerboard assay. Results in Table 1 show similarity to those obtained for M. smegmatis, such that SPC, ERY and CLR exhibited synergy with FA against M. tuberculosis. The combination of FA and ERY returned a FICI value of 0.25, indicating a synergistic interaction (Fig. S2A). Other drugs that synergized with FA included RIF, STR, roxithromycin (ROX), and LZD. These synergistic interactions generally resulted in 4-to 8-fold reductions in the MICs of each drug within the combination. Even though the combination of FA and BDQ did not result in a FICI value of \u2264 0.5, it is important to note that the two displayed approximately a 4-fold reduction in their respective MICs, and the observed FICI (0.55) was very close to that defined as \u201csynergy\u201d. No antagonistic interaction was observed between FA and any of the compounds tested. For the combinations exhibiting synergy with FA, isobolograms were constructed by plotting the FIC curves of the FA-drug combinations (Fig. S3). Interactions between FA and ERY, SPC, and RIF were well within the synergy region (FICI < 0.5) whereas FA with STR, LZD, and ROX indicated borderline synergy (FICI = 0.5). The FA-INH interaction was included as a \u201cno interaction\u201d control.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nIn vitro synergistic interaction between FA and anti TB agents or selected translational inhibitors against M. tuberculosis::gfp\n\nTo confirm results obtained using the checkerboard assay, the strongly synergistic FA-ERY combination was evaluated in a growth inhibition assay (Fig. S4). For this purpose, FA and ERY were used at 0.3 and 27 \u00b5M, respectively, since these were the concentrations at which the lowest FICI value was obtained in the checkerboard assay (Fig. S2). RIF, at a concentration of 0.015 \u00b5M, was included as a control. In the absence of drug, the population of M. tuberculosis increased over 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the population of viable cells remained relatively constant over the same duration when the growth medium contained the FA and ERY combination. Similarly, the medium containing FA, ERY plus sub-MIC RIF did not display any increase in the number of viable bacterial population over a 14-day period. In contrast, cultures incubated in the presence of the individual antibiotics, FA or ERY, showed equivalent growth to the untreated control.\n\nAssessing synergistic and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FA synergizing drugs for optimal therapy\nAs a key consideration for the clinical potential of FA combinations, the respective concentrations at which synergy was observed were compared with the reported peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) for each drug. This is important in understanding whether the concentrations required to achieve the desired response are therapeutically feasible \u2013 and, consequently, whether the results obtained from an in vitro assay have any utility in guiding therapeutic use. Except for the FA-ERY interaction, synergies between FA and its partners were achieved at concentrations predicted to be below the maximum plasma concentrations (13, 14), suggesting that these concentrations are therapeutically achievable (Fig. S5). For example, the presence of FA decreased the MIC of SPC from 201 \u00b5M to 3.14 \u00b5M, which represents a greater than 98% reduction in the MIC (Table S2). This reduced concentration is far below the Cmax value of SPC in humans (30.8 \u00b5M), determined following a 1000 mg intramuscular dose (15).\n\nAssessing cidal versus static synergies\nTo determine whether FA interactions resulted in killing or merely inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, the method of Zhang et al. was utilized (16). INH, a bactericidal agent, was used as a reference drug, and all drugs were tested alone and in combination against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp bioreporter strain. Results for the bacteriostatic or cidal effects of the drug combinations with FA are illustrated (Figure 2). The FA-RIF combination displayed a MBC/MIC ratio of \u2264 2 on day 14 of evaluation, suggesting cidality. The other combinations tested \u2013 combining FA with SPC, ERY, CLR, ROX or LZD \u2013 all exhibited MBC/MIC ratios >2, implying static effects. The bacteriostatic/cidal action of individual drugs is shown in Fig. S6.\n\nFigure 2.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 2.\nBactericidal versus static effects of drug combinations against M. tuberculosis.\nAnalysis of FA in combination with synergizing drugs; ERY, SPC, CLR, ROX, RIF, and LZD.

Error bars indicate standard deviations, calculated from the mean of triplicate samples.\n\nFA synergizing partners are active against the FA-resistant mutant\nA cross-resistance study was performed using a FA-resistant M. tuberculosis mutant carrying H462Y mutation in fusA1(11). The FA-resistant mutant exhibited >100-fold MIC compared to the FA-susceptible parental strain. Six synergistic FA partner drugs \u2013 RIF, SPC, CLR, ERY, STR and ROX \u2013 were evaluated using the resazurin reduction microplate assay (REMA). The results (Fig. S7) indicated that the MIC90 values of these drugs remained the same against the FA-resistant mutant relative to the wild-type strain, confirming that there was no cross-resistance to each of the tested compounds.\n\nInteraction of FA synergizing partners with selected chemically unrelated compounds\nUsing a set of six chemically and structurally diverse drug agents (Table S3), a combination assay was performed with four drugs that had displayed synergistic interaction with FA: RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC. The aim was to determine whether these compounds displayed synergy only with FA or exhibited a wider spectrum of synergistic interactions. The results of these pairwise combinations (Figure 3) revealed potentiating interactions between all FA synergizing partners (except RIF) and THS, BDQ and CPZ. CLR displayed strong synergies with BDQ and CPZ (FICI = 0.23 in both cases). The interaction between SPC and INH was also synergistic, while the remaining compounds (EMB and MOX) exhibited no interactions in combination with RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC.\n\nFigure 3.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nDrug interaction study.\nPairwise interactions between selected drugs (blue fonts) and synergizing agents (black fonts) of FA (using M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp.

The resulting FICI for RIF-MOX = 1.35 (green bar) which indicates an additive interaction. Data are from the representative experiment performed in duplicate.", "length": 3130}

They are serendipitous accidents.\nFor managers, the phenomenon of serendipity is interesting for a host of reasons.\n1. First of all, it reminds us that we are surrounded by opportunities that we are unaware of. And it is not as if they don\u2019t exist, simply because we don\u2019t see them...\n2.

Trying to achieve the perfect plan or a voluntary optimisation of all the management parameters is an illusion. Reality always takes the upper hand on managerial desires and is able to introduce incredible bifurcations in a market or industry. Serendipity is a random phenomenon. It is not subjected to human desires. It has given rise to hundreds of techniques, products and ideas without which life would be nothing like it is today!\nThe phenomenon of serendipity invites us to be surprised.\n 9\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nPARADIGM\nA paradigm is the ensemble of knowledge, values, certainties, beliefs, practices, habits and taboos\nof a human community with regard to a specific field at a given moment during its history.\nThis ensemble, which makes up a school of thought, a mental model, is naturally accepted, even unconsciously integrated, and is never questioned.\nIn the past, those people who chose to question a paradigm were often considered to be heretics. Often to be creative is to play with a paradigm, to question it.\nSome examples of paradigms:\nIn Antiquity the world was considered to be flat.\nBefore Galileo, Earth was the centre of the Universe.\nIn the nineteenth century, science was \u00ab the \u00bb source of progress.\nUntil a few years ago, washing powder had to really wash whiter than white.\nCars have wheels.\nBefore British inventor James Dyson vacuum cleaner \u201cobviously\u201d had to have a bag.\n 10\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nTHE ART OF CULTIVATING ONE\u2019S CURIOSITY\nWho was the idiot who said that curiosity killed the cat ? If there is one crucial creative quality, it has to be curiosity. Any person who is fuelled by a desire to understand and learn, as indicated by the etymology of the Latin word curiosus, which signifies care, desire to know, is curious.\nAlbert Einstein proudly declared: \"I do not have any particular talents. I am merely passionately curious.\" In order to valorise our creative potential, we should not hesitate to cultivate the passionate curiosity of Columbus, Marie Curie, Louis Pasteur or even Picasso. Creative people like to look elsewhere, will search deeper, and will question certainties.\nCreative people will not accept half-answers or put-offs. A creative mind will continue to look for light, where others are happy to settle for shadows. There can be no passion for science, no quest for knowledge, no desire of discovery without burning curiosity.\nAdults are often surprised, sometimes even irritated by a child\u2019s curiosity. It is true that children are indefatigable explorers: don\u2019t they naturally look towards the neighbour\u2019s garden ? Don't they open the toy boxes of their brothers and sisters and then walk away after having found what they were looking for ? Children are intrigued by the unknown. They capture it with a magic toy: the interrogative pronoun why.\nAdults on the other hand face the challenge of preserving the curiosity of the child that they have deep inside. We are all invested with a natural curiosity, which pushes us to research the why and how of things. So let's accept this and turn it into a personal asset.\n 11\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nHOW TO FEED YOUR CURIOSITY?\n1. Rather paradoxically, a curious mind usually is encouraged by one\u2019s feet! Move, get out of your house, and go take a look elsewhere. Go see what is happening in other fields, disciplines, organisations and countries, what people are thinking there. Curiosity is, above all, a passion for what is elsewhere!\n2. Ask and re-ask questions as long as the answers are not satisfactory or clearly demonstrated! Do not hesitate to wonder about the why of the why!\n3. Be enraptured about things that you did not know yet - and that you are yet to discover!\n4. Do things that you have never done before! Experiment, discover, play. Connect with reality!\n5. Child specialists affirm that one of the reasons why certain children display a lack of curiosity is due to the lack of curiosity of their parents. If a child cannot discuss its encounters and discoveries with its parents, its enthusiasm will rapidly wane. So, surround yourself with friends and colleagues who are just as curious as you are, and will share your questions and your passions. Nothing will harm a person's curiosity more than people who are not curious.\n6. Learning a foreign language is a natural source of amazement: the discovery of an unknown vocabulary and grammar will naturally lead to a new view of one\u2019s own language and culture. Those who have the opportunity \u2013 and above all, the enormous courage and perseverance \u2013 to learn Chinese or Japanese will tell you how this learning process enriched them as regards their understanding of their own way of thinking. But there is no need to learn Cantonese or Mandarin to experience all this: a few English, Spanish or German lessons will already awaken your curiosity and make you ask some pertinent questions.\n 12\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\n10FUNDAMENTAL CREATIVE ATTITUDES To practice freewheeling:\nTo suspend critical judgment:\nTo have a \u201cHow can I?\u201d attitude:\nTo separate divergence and convergence: To use your imagination:\nTo be actively curious:\nTo challenge the perception:\nTo take constrains as a chance:\nTo imagine the impossible:\nTo be open for the future:\n 13\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nTHE EFFICIENCY OF THE BRAINSTORMING!\nDuring a creative meeting, one should try to avoid certain givens. The saying goes : \u00ab It goes\nwithout saying, but is goes even better when you say it \u00bb. So let\u2019s say it!\nTHE 5 RULES OF BRAINSTORMING:\n\uf06c\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5.\nTo go for quantity of ideas : quantity breeds quality\nTo suspend the critical judgment.\nTo hitchhike on each-others ideas.\nTo be audacious and to use fantasy and imagination\nTo separate divergence and convergence, and to save enough time for the convergence.\nAvoid questioning the method proposed by the person running the meeting. He or she has chosen an approach; let him or her roll out the entire process. You may choose to go see him or her after the meeting to discuss methods.\n\uf06c Avoid asking questions that are unrelated to the subject of the meeting, do not initiate a polemic, do not launch into subjects that should be discussed during a different meeting.\n\uf06c Try to avoid interrupting the brainstorming process, regardless of the pretext. Ideas should be generated continuously, uninterruptedly.\n\uf06c Try to avoid judging your own ideas or those of others. At this stage, all ideas are acceptable. The assessment, selection and decision will come at a later stage.\n 14\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nHOW TO BECOME A\nBRILLIANT BRAINSTORMER?\nIt is relatively easy to take part in a brainstorm session and to contribute to its successful outcome. All you need to do is respect a number of essential points. Do not hesitate to share this document with participants in the next brainstorm session that you are setting up.\n1. Be 100% available, so that you can fully concentrate on the proposed creative thinking process. Switch off your mobile phone, blackberry and laptop. They should remain switched off for the duration of the meeting.\n2. Contribute unreservedly to the production of ideas. All you need to do is step in and express your ideas \u2013 every single one of them \u2013 regarding the question at hand in the most spontaneous manner possible.\n3. Express your ideas with as specific and detailed as possible. General, generic and vague ideas are public enemy no.1 when it comes to a brainstorm. The nuances and the details will help spice up the new ideas and make them more meaningful.\n4. Abstain from any form of judgment, criticism and do not comment on ideas for the duration of the meeting. Also try to avoid any form of auto-censorship! Express and write down every single idea that crops up.\n5. All that matters here is the generation of ideas. The quantity of ideas assures the quality of the ideas ! Do not hesitate to use a yellow card in case of criticism!\n6. Use the ideas of your colleagues as a launching pad. One idea will inspire another, a proposal that may seem crazy at first glance may lead to a rather promising solution. Look at an idea from every possible angle.\n7. Be audacious, imaginative, use your fantasy. Push the boundaries, go beyond your reference frame, and do away with any pre-established ideas. Go on, get on with it. A creative brainstorm is designed to provide original, unexpected, surprising solutions. Your imagination is the limit.\n8. Explore all the possible routes, without exception.\n 15\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n\nHOW TO BE AN\nEFFICIENT FACILITATOR?\nFacilitating a brainstorm session is truly a specific competence. It requires both rigour and flexibility, authority and empathy, creativity and a method.\n1. Carefully prepare the creative meeting with the project manager. Clarify three crucial questions:\n- What is the current situation?\n- What is the desired situation?\n- What are the obstacles preventing everyone from achieving the desired situation?\n2. Establish a precise agenda for the meeting in function of the time available.\nAssure a good balance between the divergent phase \u2013 the production of ideas - and the convergent phase \u2013 the assessment of ideas and the elaboration of solutions.\n3. Carefully choose the participants, they and they alone will provide the creative ideas. Make sure that there is a good balance between specialists, generalists and \u2018candid\u2019 personalities.\n4. Clearly explain the goal, the process and the agenda of the creative meeting.\nFirmly insist on the importance of the operational rules, and the fact that they should be respected throughout. Especially the \u00ab absence of a critical judgment \u00bb during the divergent phase is important.\n5. Only the facilitator is in charge of facilitating the meeting. Thus you cannot propose any ideas or suggestions \u2013 not a single one \u2013 during the meeting. Concentrate exclusively on helping your group, and make sure that everybody is participating actively.\n6. Read ideas out loud so that participants can respond to the ideas of their colleagues. Above all, do not comment or judge the quality or the originality of the ideas yourself.\n7. Ask participants to explore new routes by using creativity techniques such as the juice Press, the famous people technique, the lettering technique, the exotic animals technique, the versus technique or the crea-trends technique.\n8. Keep an eye on your watch and follow the agenda flexibly.\n 16\n\u00a9 Mark Raison - www.yellowideas.com - mark.raison@yellowideas.com - tel : +32 497 531 583\n4 STAGES OF A BRAI NSTORMING\n1.

Requirements\nOneSignal Account\nYour OneSignal App Id, available in Settings > Keys & IDs.\niOS Requirements\nAn iOS 9+ or iPadOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch) to test on. Xcode 14+ simulator works running iOS 16+.\nA Mac with Xcode 12+.\nAn iOS Push Certificate or P8 Authentication Token.\nAndroid Requirements\nAn Android 4.0.3+ device or emulator with \"Google Play Store (Services)\" installed.\nA Google/Firebase Server API Key.\nProject using AndroidX.\ncompileSDKVersion set to 33 or higher.\nAmazon & Huawei Requirements\nFollow these instructions if your app is distributed on the Amazon AppStore and/or the Huawei AppGallery.\n\nGenerate an Amazon API Key.\nHuawei Unity SDK Setup.\n\ud83d\udcd8\nRunning Example Project\n\nFor your convenience, we created an example project, based on React Native 0.63.\nYou can run this project to test configurations, debug, and build upon it.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OneSignal/react-native-onesignal\ncd react-native-onesignal && cd examples && cd RNOneSignal\nyarn\nRunning the Android example app: react-native run-android\nRunning the iOS example app:\nOpen the RNOneSignal project in Xcode\nChange the Signing Team and Bundle Identifier for both the RNOneSignal target as well as the OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension\nThe Service Extension bundle id should be .OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension\nBuild\nStep 2. Add the OneSignal package to your app\n\ud83d\udea7\nExpo Setup\n\nOneSignal is a native library and leverages the Google FCM and Apple APNS protocols. There are 2 options for adding OneSignal to your Expo Project:\n\nTry the OneSignal Expo Plugin. Recommended if you are using a Managed Expo Workflow. Follow the plugin's README for details.\nUse an Expo Bare Workflow. Follow Expo\u2019s guide on Ejecting from the Managed Workflow.\n2.1 Install the SDK using Yarn or NPM\n\nYarn: yarn add react-native-onesignal\nNPM npm install --save react-native-onesignal\n2.2 Link OneSignal (for RN versions < 0.60)\n\nSkip if using React Native version of 0.60 or greater. Autolinking is now done automatically so skip to step 3.\n\nReact Native: react-native link react-native-onesignal\n\nStep 3. Install for Android using Gradle (For Android apps)\nWithin your Android project's app/build.gradle, validate that your compile and target SDK versions are set to version 33 or higher:\n\napp/build.gradle\n\nandroid {\n compileSdkVersion 33\n ...\n\n defaultConfig {\n ...\n targetSdkVersion 33\n }\n}\nStep 4. Install for iOS using Cocoapods (For iOS Apps)\n4.1 Run cd ios && pod install\n\n4.2 Add Required Capabilities\n\nIn your project's ios directory, open the .xcworkspace file in Xcode.\n\nSelect the root project and main app target. In Signing & Capabilities, select All and + Capability. Add \"Push Notifications\".\n\n2794\nClick + Capability to add Background Modes and check Remote notifications.\n\n3024\n4.3 Add a Notification Service Extension\n\nThe OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension allows your application to receive rich notifications with images and/or buttons, and to report analytics about which notifications users receive.\n\n4.3.1 In Xcode Select File > New > Target...\n4.3.2 Select Notification Service Extension then press Next.\n\n1482\n4.3.3 Enter the product name as OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension and press Finish. Do not press \"Activate\" on the dialog shown after this.\n\n1454\n4.3.4 Press Cancel on the Activate scheme prompt.\n\n840\nBy canceling, you are keeping Xcode debugging your app, instead of just the extension. If you activate by accident, you can always switch back to debug your app within Xcode (next to the play button).\n\n4.3.5 In the Project Navigator, select the top-level project directory and select the OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension target.\n\nEnsure the Deployment Target is set to the same value as your Main Application Target. Unless you have a specific reason not to, you should set the Deployment Target to be iOS 10 which is the version of iOS that Apple released Rich Media for push. iOS versions under 10 will not be able to get Rich Media.\n\n3024\nThis should be the same value as your Main Application Target.\n\n4.3.6 In your Project Root > ios > Podfile, add the notification service extension outside the main target (should be at the same level as your main target):\n\nPodfile\nExample Podfile\n\ntarget 'OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension' do\n pod 'OneSignalXCFramework', '>= 3.0', '< 4.0'\nend\nClose Xcode. While still in the ios directory, run pod install again.\n\nRe-Open the . xcworkspace file in Xcode. In the OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension directory > NotificationService.m or NotificationService.swift file, replace the whole file contents with the code below:\n\nObjective-C\nSwift\n\n#import \n\n#import \"NotificationService.h\"\n\n@interface NotificationService ()\n\n@property (nonatomic, strong) void (^contentHandler)(UNNotificationContent \\*contentToDeliver);\n@property (nonatomic, strong) UNNotificationRequest \\*receivedRequest;\n@property (nonatomic, strong) UNMutableNotificationContent \\*bestAttemptContent;\n\n@end\n\n@implementation NotificationService\n\n- (void)didReceiveNotificationRequest:(UNNotificationRequest \\*)request withContentHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationContent \\* \\_Nonnull))contentHandler {\n self.receivedRequest = request;\n self.contentHandler = contentHandler;\n self.bestAttemptContent = [request.content mutableCopy];\n \n //If your SDK version is < 3.5.0 uncomment and use this code:\n /\\*\n [OneSignal didReceiveNotificationExtensionRequest:self.receivedRequest\n withMutableNotificationContent:self.bestAttemptContent];\n self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);\n \\*/\n \n /\\* DEBUGGING: Uncomment the 2 lines below and comment out the one above to ensure this extension is excuting\n Note, this extension only runs when mutable-content is set\n Setting an attachment or action buttons automatically adds this \\*/\n // NSLog(@\"Running NotificationServiceExtension\");\n // self.bestAttemptContent.body = [@\"[Modified] \" stringByAppendingString:self.bestAttemptContent.body];\n \n // Uncomment this line to set the default log level of NSE to VERBOSE so we get all logs from NSE logic\n //[OneSignal setLogLevel:ONE\\_S\\_LL\\_VERBOSE visualLevel:ONE\\_S\\_LL\\_NONE];\n [OneSignal didReceiveNotificationExtensionRequest:self.receivedRequest\n withMutableNotificationContent:self.bestAttemptContent\n withContentHandler:self.contentHandler];\n}\n\n- (void)serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire {\n // Called just before the extension will be terminated by the system.\n // Use this as an opportunity to deliver your \"best attempt\" at modified content, otherwise the original push payload will be used.\n \n [OneSignal serviceExtensionTimeWillExpireRequest:self.receivedRequest withMutableNotificationContent:self.bestAttemptContent];\n \n self.contentHandler(self.bestAttemptContent);\n}\n\n@end\nIgnore any build errors at this point, we will resolve these later by importing the OneSignal library.\n\n1128\n4.4 Add App Group\n\nIn order for your application to use Confirmed Deliveries and increment/decrement Badges through push notifications, you need to set up an App Group for your application.\n\n4.4.1 In your main app target go back to Signing & Capabilities > All > + Capability and add App Groups\n\n2796\n4.4.2 Under the newly added \u201cApp Groups\u201d capability click the + button.\n\nSet the \u201cApp Groups\u201d container to be group.YOUR\\_BUNDLE\\_IDENTIFIER.onesignal where YOUR\\_BUNDLE\\_IDENTIFIER is the same as shown in \"Bundle Identifier\" then press OK.\n\n1438\n4.4.3 Repeat this process for the OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension\n\nMake sure the \"App Groups\" container is the same for both targets! Do not include OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension. Then press OK.\n\n1352\nIf you require more details or troubleshooting help, see the iOS SDK App Groups setup guide.\n\nStep 5. Initialize the OneSignal SDK\nIn your App.js or index.js initialize OneSignal and try the example methods below:\n\nindex.js\n\nimport OneSignal from 'react-native-onesignal';\n\n// OneSignal Initialization\nOneSignal.setAppId(ONESIGNAL\\_APP\\_ID);\n\n// promptForPushNotificationsWithUserResponse will show the native iOS or Android notification permission prompt.\n// We recommend removing the following code and instead using an In-App Message to prompt for notification permission (See step 8)\nOneSignal.promptForPushNotificationsWithUserResponse();\n\n//Method for handling notifications received while app in foreground\nOneSignal.setNotificationWillShowInForegroundHandler(notificationReceivedEvent => {\n console.log(\"OneSignal: notification will show in foreground:\", notificationReceivedEvent);\n let notification = notificationReceivedEvent.getNotification();\n console.log(\"notification: \", notification);\n const data = notification.additionalData\n console.log(\"additionalData: \", data);\n // Complete with null means don't show a notification.\n notificationReceivedEvent.complete(notification);\n});\n\n//Method for handling notifications opened\nOneSignal.setNotificationOpenedHandler(notification => {\n console.log(\"OneSignal: notification opened:\", notification);\n});\n\ud83d\udea7\nEvent Listeners & Components\n\nWe suggest using a base/root component to add as an event listener. If you choose a sub-component that is only shown in some situations (such as using a homepage as an event listener), the component may unmount later on as the user navigates elsewhere in your app.\n\nIf you encounter problems with one or more of the events listeners, please see our troubleshooting documentation here.\n\nManually updating iOS OneSignalNativeSDK\nWhen you install react-native-onesignal it will automatically include a specific version of the OneSignal iOS native SDK that is known to work with it. Only follow the instructions below if there is a native OneSignal SDK fix you need that isn't included already in the latest react-native-onesignal update.\n\nDownload the latest OneSignal iOS native release.\nDelete libOneSignal.a and OneSignal.h from node\\_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/\nFrom /iOS\\_SDK/OneSignalSDK/Framework/OneSignal.framework/Versions/A/, copy OneSignal to /node\\_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/ and rename it libOneSignal.a\nCopy OneSignal.h from /iOS\\_SDK/OneSignalSDK/Framework/OneSignal.framework/Versions/A/Headers to /node\\_modules/react-native-onesignal/ios/\nStep 6. Run Your App and Send Yourself a Notification\nRun your app on a physical device to make sure it builds correctly. Note that the iOS Simulator does not support receiving remote push notifications.\n\niOS and Android devices should be prompted to subscribe to push notifications if you used the example setup code provided.\nCheck your OneSignal Dashboard Audience > All Users to see your Device Record.\n\nThen head over to Messages > New Push to Send your first Push Notification from OneSignal.\n\n\ud83d\udcd8\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you run into any issues please see our React Native troubleshooting guide.\n\nTry the example project on our Github repository.\n\nIf stuck, contact support directly or email support@onesignal.com for help.\n\nFor faster assistance, please provide:\n\nYour OneSignal App Id\nDetails, logs, and/or screenshots of the issue.\nSteps to reproduce\nStep 7. Set Custom User Properties\nRecommended\nAfter initialization, OneSignal will automatically collect common user data by default. Use the following methods to set your own custom userIds, emails, phone numbers, and other user-level properties.\n\nSet External User Id\nRequired if using integrations.\nRecommended for messaging across multiple channels (push, email, sms).\n\nOneSignal creates channel-level device records under a unique Id called the player\\_id. A single user can have multiple player\\_id records based on how many devices, email addresses, and phone numbers they use to interact with your app.\n\nIf your app has its own login system to track users, call setExternalUserId at any time to link all channels to a single user. For more details, see External User Ids.\n\nJavaScript\n\nlet externalUserId = '123456789'; // You will supply the external user id to the OneSignal SDK\nOneSignal.setExternalUserId(externalUserId);\nSet Email and Phone Number\nRecommended if using Email and SMS messaging.\nUse the provided SDK methods to capture email and phone number when provided. Follow the channel quickstart guides for setup:\n\nEmail Quickstart\nSMS Quickstart\nJavaScript\n\n// Pass in email provided by customer\nOneSignal.setEmail(\"example@domain.com\");\n\n// Pass in phone number provided by customer\nOneSignal.setSMSNumber(\"+11234567890\");\nData Tags\nOptional\nAll other event and user properties can be set using Data Tags. Setting this data is required for more complex segmentation and message personalization.\n\nJavaScript\n\nOneSignal.sendTag(\"key\", \"value\");\nStep 8. Implement a Soft-Prompt In-App Message\nOptional\n\nIt is recommended that apps create an alert, modal view, or other interface that describes the types of information they want to send and gives people a clear way to opt in or out.\n\nOneSignal provides an easy option for a \"soft-prompt\" using In-App Messages to meet this recommendation and have a better user experience. This also permits you to ask for permission again in the future, since the native permission prompt can no longer be shown in your app if the user clicks deny.\n\n1200\nSee our How to Prompt for Push Permissions with an In-App Message Guide for details on implementing this.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\nDone!\n\nVisit Mobile Push Tutorials for next steps.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago", "length": 3572}

Cynthia S. Goldsmith, Russell Regnery/CDC/Handout via REUTERS THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY.\nWhat is mpox? Dr. Gupta explains how this rare virus spreads\n(CNN)A sugar replacement called erythritol -- used to add bulk or sweeten stevia, monkfruit and keto reduced-sugar products -- has been linked to blood clotting, stroke, heart attack and death, according to a new study.\n\n\"The degree of risk was not modest,\" said lead study author Dr. Stanley Hazen, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Diagnostics and Prevention at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute.\nPeople with existing risk factors for heart disease, such as diabetes, were twice as likely to experience a heart attack or stroke if they had the highest levels of erythritol in their blood, according to the study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\"If your blood level of erythritol was in the top 25% compared to the bottom 25%, there was about a two-fold higher risk for heart attack and stroke. It's on par with the strongest of cardiac risk factors, like diabetes,\" Hazen said.\nAdditional lab and animal research presented in the paper revealed that erythritol appeared to be causing blood platelets to clot more readily. Clots can break off and travel to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or to the brain, triggering a stroke.\n\"This certainly sounds an alarm,\" said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health, a hospital in Denver, who was not involved in the research.\n\"There appears to be a clotting risk from using erythritol,\" Freeman said. \"Obviously, more research is needed, but in an abundance of caution, it might make sense to limit erythritol in your diet for now.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn response to the study, the Calorie Control Council, an industry association, told CNN that \"the results of this study are contrary to decades of scientific research showing reduced-calorie sweeteners like erythritol are safe, as evidenced by global regulatory permissions for their use in foods and beverages,\" said Robert Rankin, the council's executive director, in an email.\nThe results \"should not be extrapolated to the general population, as the participants in the intervention were already at increased risk for cardiovascular events,\" Rankin said.\nThe European Association of Polyol Producers declined to comment, saying it had not reviewed the study.\nWhat is erythritol?\nLike sorbitol and xylitol, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, a carb found naturally in many fruits and vegetables. It has about 70% of the sweetness of sugar and is considered zero-calorie, according to experts.\nArtificially manufactured in massive quantities, erythritol has no lingering aftertaste, doesn't spike blood sugar and has less of a laxative effect than some other sugar alcohols.\n\"Erythritol looks like sugar, it tastes like sugar, and you can bake with it,\" said Hazen, who also directs the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Microbiome and Human Health.\n\"It's become the sweetheart of the food industry, an extremely popular additive to keto and other low-carb products and foods marketed to people with diabetes,\" he added. \"Some of the diabetes-labeled foods we looked at had more erythritol than any other item by weight.\"\nErythritol is also the largest ingredient by weight in many \"natural\" stevia and monkfruit products, Hazen said. Because stevia and monkfruit are about 200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar, just a small amount is needed in any product. The bulk of the product is erythritol, which adds the sugar-like crystalline appearance and texture consumers expect.\nAn unexpected discovery\nThe discovery of the connection between erythritol and cardiovascular issues was purely accidental, Hazen said: \"We never expected this. We weren't even looking for it.\"\nHazen's research had a simple goal: find unknown chemicals or compounds in a person's blood that might predict their risk for a heart attack, stroke or death in the next three years. To do so, the team began analyzing 1,157 blood samples in people at risk for heart disease collected between 2004 and 2011.\n\"We found this substance that seemed to play a big role, but we didn't know what it was,\" Hazen said. \"Then we discovered it was erythritol, a sweetener.\"\nThe human body naturally creates erythritol but in very low amounts that would not account for the levels they measured, he said.\nTo confirm the findings, Hazen's team tested another batch of blood samples from over 2,100 people in the United States and an additional 833 samples gathered by colleagues in Europe through 2018. About three-quarters of the participants in all three populations had coronary disease or high blood pressure, and about a fifth had diabetes, Hazen said. Over half were male and in their 60s and 70s.\nIn all three populations, researchers found that higher levels of erythritol were connected to a greater risk of heart attack, stroke or death within three years.\nBut why? To find out, researchers did further animal and lab tests and discovered that erythritol was \"provoking enhanced thrombosis,\" or clotting in the blood, Hazen said.\nClotting is necessary in the human body, or we would bleed to death from cuts and injuries. The same process is constantly happening internally, as well.\n\"Our blood vessels are always under pressure, and we spring leaks, and blood platelets are constantly plugging these holes all the time,\" Hazen said.\nHowever, the size of the clot made by platelets depends on the size of the trigger that stimulates the cells, he explained. For example, if the trigger is only 10%, then you only get 10% of a clot.\n\"But what we're seeing with erythritol is the platelets become super responsive: A mere 10% stimulant produces 90% to 100% of a clot formation,\" Hazen said.\n\"For people who are at risk for clotting, heart attack and stroke -- like people with existing cardiac disease or people with diabetes -- I think that there's sufficient data here to say stay away from erythritol until more studies are done,\" Hazen said.\nOliver Jones, a professor of chemistry at RMIT University in Victoria, Australia, noted that the study had revealed only a correlation, not causation.\n\"As the authors themselves note, they found an association between erythritol and clotting risk, not definitive proof such a link exists,\" Jones, who was not involved in the research, said in a statement.\n\"Any possible (and, as yet unproven) risks of excess erythritol would also need to be balanced against the very real health risks of excess glucose consumption,\" Jones said.\nHealthy volunteers\nIn a final part of the study, eight healthy volunteers drank a beverage that contained 30 grams of erythritol, the amount many people in the US consume, Hazen said, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which examines American nutrition each year.\nBlood tests over the next three days tracked erythritol levels and clotting risk.\n\"Thirty grams was enough to make blood levels of erythritol go up a thousandfold,\" Hazen said. \"It remained elevated above the threshold necessary to trigger and heighten clotting risk for the following two to three days.\"\nJust how much is 30 grams of erythritol? The equivalent of eating a pint of keto ice cream, Hazen said.\n\"If you look at nutrition labels on many keto ice creams, you'll see 'reducing sugar' or 'sugar alcohol,' which are terms for erythritol. You'll find a typical pint has somewhere between 26 and 45 grams in it,\" he said.\n\"My co-author and I have been going to grocery stores and looking at labels,\" Hazen said. \"He found a 'confectionery' marketed to people with diabetes that had about 75 grams of erythritol.\"\nThere is no firm \"accepted daily intake,\" or ADI, set by the European Food Safety Authority or the US Food and Drug Administration, which considers erythritol generally recognized as safe (GRAS).\n\"Science needs to take a deeper dive into erythritol and in a hurry, because this substance is widely available right now. If it's harmful, we should know about it,\" National Jewish Health's Freeman said.\nHazen agreed: \"I normally don't get up on a pedestal and sound the alarm,\" he said. \"But this is something that I think we need to be looking at carefully.\"", "length": 3217}
{"prompt": "1\nNew stories always start in the first town\nToday was one of those days when the sun lights up the world with crisp, clear rays and everything feels new.\nI was standing in front of the full-length mirror in my room, locked in an inner struggle.\n\u201c\u2026No, that\u2019s not quite right\u2026\u201d\nI had a black Chesterfield coat in my right hand and a black down jacket in my left, trying to decide through trial and error which one to wear.\n\u201cThis one would be the safe Hinami-style choice\u2026but\u2026\u201d I slipped on the Chesterfield.\nI could wear a white sweater underneath with my black slim-fit\u2026what were they? Slacks. If I put the round red scarf thing\u2014I mean, \u201csnood\u201d on top of that and wore my red socks, my easy Hinami-style outfit would be complete. The black-and-white elements tied the whole thing together, but the splash of red at the top and bottom made me seem stylish enough that you\u2019d never guess I was a born-and-bred gamer. I\u2019d worn that very outfit on multiple occasions and personally experienced its effectiveness.\nBut\u2026\n\u201cThree times could be pushing it\u2026\u201d\nYeah. This outfit Hinami chose for me is my trump card for going out in street clothes in winter, and I\u2019ve played it eagerly every time I had a chance this winter break. If this was a Hydro Pump, I\u2019d have just two PP left.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to think I have only one outfit\u2026\u201d\nThat wasn\u2019t fun to imagine. I\u2019d seen Kikuchi-san twice over break so far, and both times, I\u2019d thrown down that trump card without hesitating. I might be able to get away with wearing the same clothes twice, but I bet even Kikuchi-san would have some questions if I wore them a third time.\nShe might even change her opinion about me. I could see her now, trying\n\nnot to hurt my feelings.\nIn my mind, she struggled to find the words, then finally said\u2014\n\nTomozaki-kun\u2026have you ever washed that?\n\n\u201cAhhhhhhh!!\u201d\nI leaped away from the mirror, stung by her imaginary voice. This time, it was just an emotional wound, but if Kikuchi-san said that to me in real life, I\u2019d instantaneously turn into a blade of grass or something. Considering that I\u2019d managed to advance from a completely unsophisticated nerd to a somewhat sophisticated nerd, it would suck if I turned into a plant and lost all that progress.\n\u201c\u2026So maybe this one, then?\u201d\nI put on the down jacket in my left hand. I\u2019d bought this without any help from Hinami.\nAfter wearing my \u201cmannequin clothes\u201d enough times, I\u2019d gotten both a logical and an instinctive sense for how they\u2019re different from what I used to wear before. Lately, I\u2019d also been looking at the outfits posted by stylish people on a fashion app that Hinami told me about, then trying to see what they all had in common.\nStrangely enough, that\u2019s allowed me to start seeing things that I used to filter out because I thought stylish people lived in another world\u2014and now I kinda have something resembling a personal preference.\nI mean, this down jacket is the first item of clothing I ever bought because I liked it. Well, to be more accurate, I actually stole the idea from an outfit I liked on that app. Come to think of it, it\u2019s basically the online version of buying the whole mannequin.\nKikuchi-san had never seen it before. Even if I wore it with the same slacks, the overall look should be different enough that she wouldn\u2019t think I had only one outfit.\nWithout giving it much thought, I put the down jacket on over the white sweater I\u2019d worn with the Chesterfield coat.\n\u201c\u2026Nice!\u201d\nThe white sleeves were sticking out from the sleeves of the jacket, which were surprisingly short given its bulky width. I\u2019d figured that with the pants,\n\nI\u2019d be all black, but the white at my wrists made for a nice contrast that seemed fairly intentional. Since the jacket\u2019s sleeves were so short, you\u2019d be able to see the sweater from behind, too.\n\u201cAha!\u201d\nSuddenly, inspiration struck, and I pulled off the red socks I\u2019d had on to match the snood and replaced them with a white pair.\nI checked myself in the mirror again. \u201c\u2026Oooh!\u201d\nThe reflection staring back at me had on a black down jacket, a white sweater, black slacks, and white socks, which ended up giving me a black- and-white stripe vibe. It would probably sound better if I knew a more style- savvy word than stripes, but I don\u2019t\u2014point is, I looked like one of those guys on the app.\n\u201cIt works!!\u201d I shouted, spinning around.\nI was excited about this kinda-almost-stylish version of myself in the mirror. If my mind wasn\u2019t playing tricks on me, I might have just discovered a new outfit.\nThen I realized something. I\u2019d always been either cribbing off the mannequin or basing off the ones that Hinami had designed for me\u2014which would make this my very first original outfit, right?\n\u201cYooooooooo!\u201d\nI was getting all wound up now as I struck various poses in the outfit I\u2019d created for myself. I was, again, taking inspiration from the app, since the models didn\u2019t usually take their pictures just standing there like a statue. I thought I looked pretty good, which got me even more excited.\n\u201cI did it!!\u201d\n\u201cShut up!!\u201d\nSuddenly, the door banged open.\nI froze in my model stance, face-to-face with my little sister, who was very annoyed.\n\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d \u201cUm\u2026\u201d\nShe looked extremely dubious\u2014scornful, even. I looked back at her, my weight still on my right foot and my right hand resting on my right shoulder. Uh.\nVery gradually, I unfolded myself and straightened my body. Slowly, ever\n\nso slowly. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t notice anything had happened.\nOnce I was standing upright again, I took a breath and said solemnly, \u201cSorry for being so loud.\u201d\n\u201cI saw you, y\u2019know.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d\nThe attempted cover-up was a bust, and my sister was having none of it. \u201c\u2026You\u2019re such a weirdo.\u201d\nWith that, she shut the door in my face. \u201cH-hey, wait\u2026!\u201d\nBut she didn\u2019t hear me, and I was left alone in my room. She was a year younger than me, but her words hit like a punch to the face.\n\u201cOof.\u201d\nI was dying of embarrassment\u2014but at the same time, the nuance of the word felt slightly different from when she\u2019d called me a weirdo in the past. The phrase when she\u2019d called me a weirdo in the past is very sad, but anyway, the point is that I noticed a difference.\nI used to feel powerless when she said that, or even a sense of failure, like I was lower than her\u2014I still did, a little\u2014but it wasn\u2019t as strong as before.\nI checked myself again in the mirror. \u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201d\nYeah, a few months ago, I couldn\u2019t have even imagined myself looking like this.\nMy hair, which I\u2019d styled this morning, was decently neat. The smile I\u2019d worked so hard to master was fairly natural. My newly invented outfit was pretty stylish.\nAll that gave me\u2014the character Fumiya Tomozaki, who\u2019s living this life\n\u2014a kind of confidence in my ability to raise my stats.\nAnd best of all\u2014I was on my way to meet someone I wanted to see in a place I wanted to go.\nI was familiar with this feeling; nanashi would never think he was a weak player just because he lost one game.\nThe results of the work I\u2019d put in bit by bit was showing on both the inside and the outside. That was my winrate in life, and getting caught in an embarrassing moment by my sister didn\u2019t make me a loser.\nAnd now I could see it myself.\nSo I stepped confidently in front of the mirror one more time.\n\nI struck a pose. The door banged open again. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it again? Weirdo.\u201d\nThe door slammed shut, and for the second time in several minutes, I was plunged into shame. Okay, this was different. Two times in a row was rough. Seriously, though, what\u2019s with her? At least knock. I dived onto my bed.\n\u201cGahhhhhhhh!!\u201d\nEven for me, being called a weirdo twice in five minutes sent my confidence right into the red. I buried my face in my pillow, hoping to purge some of the embarrassment by screaming it out. It was hopeless. I\u2019m an embarrassment to society.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nAt a few minutes to ten in the morning, I was standing in front of the Bean Tree sculpture at Omiya Station.\nIn my new outfit, I awaited her arrival.\nNormally, Omiya Station is packed with all kinds of people, from students and drunks to talent scouts and girls in crazy outfits. It has a kind of messy feeling. But today, everyone walking through the station seemed to share the same feeling\u2014probably because today was New Year\u2019s Day.\nEveryone had put down the baggage of the previous year and was getting ready to take in fresh experiences and emotions. We were all drawing a line between past and present and putting an end to certain intangible things in our lives. There was something ritualistic about it. Not exactly the most logical thing in the world, but I like the way this day of the year feels.\nIt\u2019s a chance to end some things neatly, to free up a little bit of your limited capacity so you have room for something special and new. Like when your inventory is full and you find mini medals\u2014 Okay, sorry, I know this is getting old, but comparing this stuff to games is just a habit of mine by now.\nI smiled wryly at myself, and then I noticed the person I\u2019d been waiting for was walking toward the ticket gate.\n\u201cTomozaki-kun.\u201d\nKikuchi-san walked toward me from the station\u2019s east exit, wearing a green coat. It was long and had a fancy-looking, slightly furry texture that suited her perfectly. I\u2019m fairly sure the fluffy sky-blue scarf she had on was a\n\nblend of wool and angel feathers. \u201cMorning, Kikuchi-san.\u201d \u201cGood morning.\u201d\nAfter our greeting, which hadn\u2019t changed one bit from before, she stepped alongside me. I loved how easy and natural that movement was. She wasn\u2019t unsure anymore whether she was in the right place.\n\u201cShould we get going?\u201d \u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nWe set off, walking very close to each other\u2014which was a huge change from before.\n\nIt all started at the school festival; the play we put on as a class was the catalyst for me and Kikuchi-san to start dating.\nAs individuals, we were basically the same people, but our relationship had changed drastically. I was her first boyfriend, and she was my first girlfriend.\nWe walked down the stairs outside the east exit and cut in front of the bronze statue of Toto-chan the squirrel. A little boy was leaning over the banister next to the statue, battering Toto-chan with his hand warmer like it was a beanbag. He stared curiously at us. I can\u2019t see Kikuchi-san\u2019s holy aura anymore, but I bet for an innocent child, it\u2019s clear as could be. Kikuchi-san must have felt him looking at her, because she looked back and smiled quietly at him. He waved at us happily.\n\u201c\u2026He\u2019s so cute,\u201d she said, shifting her gentle gaze from him to me. She seemed to be enjoying the moment.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nYou\u2019re the cute one, I thought, but even the words were so corny that I told myself not to say them. Man, her priceless smile and those warm feelings are good omens for the year. They\u2019ve gotta be right up there with seeing the sunrise on January 1. This really is a happy New Year. No complaints.\nKikuchi-san waved daintily at the little boy, then continued past the front of the station with me. Hikawa Shrine, where we were headed, was actually closer to Kita-Omiya Station, but the route was simpler from Omiya. But really, I thought walking through the Omiya neighborhood together like this would give a different feel to a familiar place, so I chose that station as our\n\nmeeting spot.\nGood choice, I think.\nSomehow, the mood was lively and calm all at once. The time drifted by pleasantly, with no positive or negative expectations. It reminded me of when we went to see the fireworks. We were just walking along together, our hearts full of warmth.\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d We reached a corner, and Kikuchi-san seemed unsure where to go next.\n\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201d I pointed and kept walking calmly ahead. She smiled, reassured, and strolled alongside me like she was putting herself in my hands. She was dressed for the weather, and her breath as she spoke was a misty white.\n\u201cThink all these people are going to the shrine for their New Year\u2019s visit?\u201d\n\u201cProbably,\u201d she said, giggling a little. \u201cHa-ha, yeah.\u201d\nThe crowd swelled more as we neared Hikawa Shrine. The flow of people naturally pushed us closer together, but I didn\u2019t totally freak out. The cold January air cooled my very slightly flushed cheeks.\nThe long road was paved with cement blocks. We passed rows of beauty salons and vintage shops until we came to the end of Ichinomiya Road and took the crosswalk. Then we passed under the shrine gate, looking at the big rocks on either side. We were now on the road leading to the main building at Hikawa Shrine, which was arrow straight and probably a few hundred meters long, with three paths running parallel between rows of trees. When you think about it, this lengthy, wide triple road that goes right through a residential neighborhood is fairly strange. I bet you wouldn\u2019t see it anywhere else.\nThe crowd was even thicker now that we were near the shrine, and Kikuchi-san and I were so close that our shoulders kept bumping. Suddenly, out of sight, my fingers brushed hers.\nBut it was fine. I mean, this was naturally what should happen between us\u2026right? Yeah, no.\n\u201c\u2026Oh!\u201d\n\u201cUh, s-sorry! Ah-ha-ha!\u201d\nOverreacting to Kikuchi-san\u2019s very quiet gasp of surprise, I withdrew my\n\nhand. Strange. We\u2019d full-on held hands during the school festival, but I guess now that we were back to everyday life, we weren\u2019t up to it.", "length": 3605}
{"prompt": "We were having a nice, relaxed time when I remembered something else. This sort of peaceful time never lasted long in the record-breakingly successful game of life as engineered by Hinami-san.\nRight. My assignment.\n\nI stood next to Kikuchi-san, thinking back a few days, back to what Hinami-san had told me.\n\nIt was the end of December, and we were in an Italian place in Kitayono.\nHinami and I sat facing each other.\nWe\u2019d come to the same place after I told off Erika Konno. Hinami is crazy for the salad here. I\u2019ve gotta admit, it really is good.\n\u201cAnyway, about your winter-break exercises\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to slip that by me just being casual about it. What exercises?\u201d\nHinami sighed softly. Since I started this game, she\u2019s never once given me an easy assignment. She always aims for the very limit of what I\u2019m capable of. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve been able to raise my level, but I knew this wasn\u2019t going to be some simple little holiday training.\n\u201cNow, now, if you\u2019re going to talk like that, maybe I should make it as hard as usual.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI just can\u2019t decide,\u201d she said with a smile. She was baiting me, and I tried to ignore her because she was being so annoying, but I was too curious.\n\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t decide what?\u201d \u201cOh, you want to know?\u201d \u201cN-not especially.\u201d\nI tried to play it off, but she just said, \u201cIs that so?\u201d and smiled. Then she picked up her fork, elegantly stabbed several pieces of salad, and eagerly shoved them in her mouth. She was definitely doing this on purpose. Which of course made me more curious.\n\u201cAhhh, this is so good.\u201d \u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\nGrinning, she delicately sipped her black tea. She had a certain childishness when she ate that wasn\u2019t visible in Hinami the final boss. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her as we talked.\n\u201cThe veggies are fresh, of course, but I think the combination of flavors and the dressing are what truly make it delicious.\u201d\n\u201cO-oh.\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten much. If you don\u2019t want it, I can help you out,\u201d she\n\nsaid, extending her fork in my direction. \u201cNo thanks\u2026I\u2019m gonna eat.\u201d\nMy brain wasn\u2019t working right after the two-hit combo of Hinami\u2019s intriguing words and her strangely attractive way of enjoying her food, but I knew enough to defend my salad. I mean, it really was good stuff.\n\u201c\u2026So what were you starting to say?\u201d\n\u201cYou want to know?\u201d She gave me a smug smile. God, what a jerk. \u201cNot especially\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\nI\u2019m virtually incapable of just doing what I\u2019m told, so my resistance was instinctive. So she ignored me and went on eating her salad. Damn her.\n\u201c\u2026You said something about \u2018as hard as usual,\u2019 didn\u2019t you? So that means this one is going to be easier?\u201d\n\u201cI knew you were curious.\u201d \u201cArgh\u2026\u201d\nThat was all I could get out, and she was satisfied. Ready to stop tormenting me yet?\n\u201cI was just going to mention that you could take it easy around the New Year holiday.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t expected that. She\u2019s obsessed with efficiency and hates wasting a single second. I figured she\u2019d say something like The New Year is just another day a bunch of idiots decided to make special. So her proposal surprised me.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d\nShe smiled kindly and nodded. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t let you do absolutely nothing. I just meant that you can take a few breaks here and there.\u201d\n\u201cI c-can?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, displaying another kindly smile. \u201cAfter all, you were able to achieve your mid-term goal with time to spare.\u201d\nThe compliment was my reward for my hard work. \u201cYeah. I guess so.\u201d\nA wave of happiness washed over me.\nThe objective she\u2019d given me was to have a girlfriend by the time I started my third year.\nWhen I\u2019d met her in June, that seemed like a completely impossible task,\n\nbut by the end of the second semester, I\u2019d told Kikuchi-san I liked her, and we started dating. I\u2019d reached my goal more than three months early.\nWithin six months of working at the game of life, I\u2019d managed to get my first girlfriend, which seemed like a major checkpoint on the path to victory.\nI was happy simply to be dating the person I liked, but I was also feeling that primal excitement at accomplishing something I really wanted to achieve.\nWhatever game you\u2019re playing, that\u2019s always one of the best moments. \u201cI do\u2026have a girlfriend now,\u201d I said with some emotion.\n\u201cYou do,\u201d Hinami said calmly and nodded.\nWhen she looked at me, her expression was scornful. \u201cWhy are you getting all worked up? Ugh.\u201d\n\u201cSh-shut up! I can\u2019t help it!\u201d\nAs soon as I felt my nostrils flaring in excitement, I half expected her to say something like that, but her reaction was mean. I had to push back at least a little.\n\u201cAnyway, you were saying I get an easy assignment for winter break?!\u201d I asked, changing the subject.\nGiving me a sudden smile, she finished off her salad and looked down regretfully at the plate.\n\u201cRight. I mean, you chose her yourself, so you\u2019ll be moving things along without me telling you, right?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Move things along how?\u201d I echoed.\n\u201cYou know, hold hands, kiss, things like that,\u201d she said casually. \u201cHold hands and kiss?!\u201d\n\u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said\u2026holding hands? And kiss!\u201d\n\u201cStop repeating yourself.\u201d She scowled at me for being stupid, and\u2026 Yeah, I was talking like Takei now.\nI was sounding as stupid as Takei now, and she glanced down and paused for a moment like she was resetting the mood before looking up at me again.\n\u201cBut that part\u2019s not so important anyway.\u201d \u201c\u2026I-it\u2019s not?\u201d\nShe raised one finger and pointed at me. \u201cWhat is your big goal?\u201d \u201cUm,\u201d I said. \u201cTo reach the same status as you?\u201d\nIf my calculations were correct, she was probably about to say Hexactly.\n\nShe pointed at me. \u201cHexactly.\u201d\n\u201cCalled it,\u201d I said, before I could stop myself. \u201cCalled what?\u201d She tilted her head.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, trying to avoid the topic even as I recognized my mistake.\n\u201cHmph. Then would you mind not interrupting me?\u201d \u201cOh, u-uh, sorry.\u201d\nSomehow, even though I had predicted what she would say, she still had control of the conversation. Very strange.\nMeanwhile, she continued as if nothing had happened.\n\u201cBy reaching my status, I mean when it comes to our school. You can hold hands with Kikuchi-san or kiss her or do whatever comes after, but that\u2019s all part of your own little couple world. It has nothing to do with becoming a normie in the world of school.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026that makes sense.\u201d\nI was slightly unnerved by the casual way she mentioned, \u201cwhatever comes after,\u201d but she did have a point. Even if people talk about me because of our relationship, developing that relationship wouldn\u2019t make me popular at school. If I told my guy friends what was happening, all they\u2019d do was say that I had it going on or poke me in the ribs.\n\u201cOf course, some people consider themselves normies as long as they\u2019ve got a happy relationship, and I don\u2019t intend to contradict them. But your goal is to rival me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you definitely don\u2019t get your status from dating.\u201d\nWhen I thought about it, I\u2019d never heard anyone say she had a boyfriend, at least since second year started, yet she still had an iron grip on her place at the top of the heap. You don\u2019t normally see someone with that status without a significant other.\n\u201cYou\u2019re aiming for the same position. So you may have found a comfortable spot with your girlfriend, but you can\u2019t just sit there. You need to keep breaking new ground.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I get what you\u2019re saying,\u201d I said cooperatively.\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, smiling confidently. \u201cYour big goal is especially useful as a guidepost at times like this when it\u2019s hard to know how to proceed. Do you see now why it was so important to decide those at the beginning?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Yeah.\u201d\nI had a girlfriend, which at first glance looked like the finish line. I wanted to be a normie, so I got a girlfriend\u2014now what? If I didn\u2019t have a bigger goal in mind, I probably wouldn\u2019t know what to do next.\nBut simply having that overarching idea sharpened my thoughts. Most games have clear objectives and standards for winning and losing, so you don\u2019t waste too much time wandering around, but the level of freedom in this game is too high.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to tell you what your next mid-term goal is.\u201d \u201cTh-that sounds important\u2026\u201d\nA goal to replace the goal of getting a girlfriend. I\u2019d come to that major fork in the road, and now I was heading for the next one. Guess you could call it part two of the game of life.\n\u201cIt is. This one\u2019s slightly difficult, but I\u2019d like you to achieve it by summer.\u201d\nAs she spoke, she placed a small, closed notebook on the table. Then she slowly announced the big reveal.\n\n\u201cYour next mid-term goal\u2014is to become the central figure in a group of at least four people.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026The central figure?\u201d\nI kind of understood what that meant, and I kind of didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t quite picture what I\u2019d need to do or how hard it would be.\n\u201cUm, so what does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cWell. Basically\u2026\u201d Hinami opened the notebook and took out a black ballpoint pen. Our empty salad plates had been cleared away, leaving only my iced tea and Hinami\u2019s lemon tea. \u201cSo there are several groups in our class, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d\nShe tapped the first page of the notebook with her pen. \u201cDo you know which groups there are?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026there\u2019s Nakamura\u2019s, then yours. And Konno\u2019s gyaru group\u2026\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d She wrote down the groups I\u2019d named in the notebook. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhat I mean by the central figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThat\u2019s what \u201cwhat\u201d meant?\n\u201cNeed me to explain?\u201d she asked smugly, circling the name of each group.\nNakamura Group. Hinami Group. Konno Group. \u201cOhhh\u2026\u201d\nGotcha.\n\u201cYou mean I have to make my own group, like Nakamura and you and Konno.\u201d\nAgain, I had a feeling I knew what she was about to say. \u201cHexactly.\u201d\n\u201cCalled it.\u201d \u201cCalled what?\u201d\nI was starting to have an intuitive sense for when she\u2019d bring it out. \u201cNothing.\u201d\nThis time, I was the smug one, but I pulled myself together and took another look at the names in the notebook. Hinami was grumpy with me now.\nNakamura Group. Hinami Group. Konno Group.\nWhich meant\u2026\n\u201c\u2026I gotta make the Tomozaki Group, right?\u201d I sensed it again.\n\u201cHe\u2014 That\u2019s correct.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d\nWhere\u2019d her hexactly go? I felt like I heard her start to say it, but\u2026 She threw me a victorious look.\n\u201cWeird\u2026,\u201d I mumbled. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIf it\u2019s nothing, could you please stop interrupting me?\u201d She sighed reproachfully.\n\u201cS-sorry.\u201d\nShe was right that I\u2019d been cutting her off with my strange reactions all day. I should cut that out.\nHinami sharpened her gaze, apparently refocusing herself.\n\u201cYou can do it in class or in some other group. Either way, you need to create a clique that you can confidently call the Tomozaki Group. That\u2019s your\n\nfocus from now on.\u201d\nIt sounded simple, and I had a clear image of the destination I was aiming for. But with my current strength, getting there would be difficult, and I still didn\u2019t have a concrete idea of what I should do. Just like last time.\nI realized something. \u201cOh, I guess that does make sense.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026What does?\u201d she asked, checking her messages on her phone, which had just buzzed.\n\u201cI was just thinking you\u2019re right that it\u2019s not very connected to what Kikuchi-san and I do.\u201d\nHinami raised her eyebrows, and the corners of her mouth rose, too.\n\u201cSo you get it. Anyway, the point is that being a normie is about more than romance.\u201d\n\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d\nI recalled the assignments she\u2019d given me.\n\u201cNow that I think about it, you even made developing friendships with guys one of my goals.\u201d\nHer assignments were like that from the start. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d always been planning for this checkpoint, but at that stage, she\u2019d already decided on the direction I needed to aim for.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. And now you\u2019ve met your romantic goals, to some extent. That\u2019s why moving forward, I intend to make your assignments focus mainly on gaining skills and taking actions that will position you as the central figure in a wider network of people.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, then, let\u2019s talk about your next small goal. Your first assignment in working toward your real red-letter event\u2026\u201d\nI gulped, waiting for her to go on.\n\n\u201cHold hands with Fuka-chan by your third date.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, you said you\u2019d lay off the romantic stuff!\u201d I shot back, confused. Hinami just looked at me with a teasingly sadistic smile.", "length": 3346}

For example, instead of saying \"managed a team,\" say \"led a team of 10 people, resulting in a 20% increase in productivity.\"\n\nHighlight specific accomplishments: Focus on specific projects or tasks you completed that had a positive impact on your organization. For example, \"developed and implemented a new marketing strategy that led to a 50% increase in sales.\"\n\nUse action verbs: Start your accomplishment statements with action verbs like \"increased,\" \"improved,\" \"implemented,\" \"reduced,\" etc. This makes your achievements sound more active and impressive.\n\nBe specific: Avoid general statements like \"contributed to the company's success.\" Instead, be specific about what you contributed, such as \"introduced a new process that reduced costs by 25%.\"\n\nShow the impact: Explain how your achievements had a positive impact on your organization, such as \"my efforts led to increased revenue and improved customer satisfaction.\"\n\nRemember, the goal is to show potential employers how you can bring value to their organization based on your previous successes. By emphasizing your achievements in your CV, you demonstrate that you are a results-oriented professional who can make a difference in the workplace.\n\nShare Prompt\n\"Share Prompt", "length": 3421}

{"prompt": "rewrite these flash pieces in a roald dahl and mark twain fun witty voice easy for 10 year olds to undesrstand. but do not omit any details from the stories: There are tw. ways of describing the city of \nP9rothea: you can say that four aluminum towers \nrise from its walls flanking seven gates with spring\u0002operated drawbridges that span the moat whose \nwater feeds four green canals which cross the city, \ndividing it into nine quarters, each with three \nhundred houses and seven hundred chimneys. And \nbearing in mind that the nubile girls of each quarter \nmarry youths of other quarters and their parents ex\u0002change the goods that each family holds in mo\u0002nopoly-bergamot, sturgeon roe, astrolabes, ame\u0002thysts--you can then work from these facts until you \nlearn everything you wish about the city in the past, \npresent, and future. Or else you can say, like the \ncamel driver who took me there: \"I arrived here in \nmy first youth, one morning, many people were hur\u0002rying along the streets toward the market, the \nwomen had fine teeth and looked you straight in the \neye, three soldiers on a platform played the trumpet, \nand all around wheels turned and colored banners \nfluttered in the wind. Before then I had known only \nthe desert and the caravan routes. In the years that \nfollowed, my eyes returned to contemplate the desert \nexpanses and the caravan routes; but now I know this \npath is only one of the many that opened before me \non that morning in Dorothea.\" \n9 \nIn vain, great-hearted Kublai, shall I attempt to \ndescribe Zaira, city of high bastions. I could tell you \nhow many steps make up the streets rising like stair\u0002ways, and the degree of the arcades' curves, and what \nkind of zinc scales cover the roofs; but I already \nknow this would be the same as telling you nothing. \nThe city does not consist of this, but of relationships \nbetween the measurements of its space and the events \nof its past: the height of a lamppost and the distance \nfrom the ground of a hanged usurper's swaying feet; \nthe line strung from the lamPPOSt to the railing op\u0002posite and the festoons that decorate the course of the \nqueen's nuptial procession; the height of that railing \nand the leap of the adulterer who climbed over it at \ndawn; the tilt of a guttering and a eat's progress \nalong it as he slips into the same window; the firing \nrange of a gunboat which has suddenly appeared \nbeyond the cape and the bomb that destroys the gut\u0002tering; the rips in the fish net and the three old men \nseated on the dock mending nets and telling each \nother for the hundredth time the Story of the gun- 10 \nboat of the usurper, who some say was the queen's il\u0002legitimate son, abandoned in his swaddling clothes \nthere on the dock. \nAs this wave from memories flows in, the city \nsoaks it up like a sponge and expands. A description \nof Zaira as it is today should contain all Zaira's past. \nThe city, however, does not tell its past, but con\u0002tains it like the lines of a hand, written in the \ncorners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, \nthe banisters of the steps, the antennae of the light\u0002ning rods, the poles of the Bags, every segment \nmarked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls. \n11 \nAt the end of three days, moving southward, you \ncome upon Anastasia, a city with concentric canals \nwatering it and kites flying over it. I should now list \nthe wares that can profitably be bought here: agate, \nonyx, chrysoprase, and other varieties of chalcedony; \nI should praise the flesh of the golden pheasant \ncooked here over fires of seasoned cherry wood and \nsprinkled with much sweet marjoram; and tell of the \nwomen I have seen bathing in the pool of a garden \nand who sometimes-it is said-invite the stranger \nto disrobe with them and chase them in the water. \nBut with all this, I would not be telling you the \ncity's true essence; for while the description of Anas\u0002tasia awakens desires one at a time only to force you \nto stifle them, when you are in the heart of Anastasia \none morning your desires waken all at once and sur\u0002round you. The city appears to you as a whole where \nno desire is lost and of which you are a part, and \nsince it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can \ndo nothing but inhabit this desire and be content. \nSuch is the power, sometimes called malignant, \nsometimes benign, that Anastasia, the treacherous \ncity, possesses; if for eight hours a day you work as a \ncutter of agate, onyx, chrysoprase, your labor which \ngives form to desire takes from desire its form, and \nyou believe you are enjoying Anastasia wholly when \nyou are only its slave. \n12 \nYou walk for days among trees and among stones. \nRarely does the eye light on a thing, and then only \nwhen it has recognized that thing as the sign of \nanother thing: a print\u00b7 in the sand indicates the \ntiger's passage; a marsh announces a vein of water; \nthe hibiscus flower, the end of winter. All the rest is \nsilent and interchangeable; trees and stones are only \nwhat they are. \nFinally the journey leads to the city of Tamara. \nYou penetrate it along streets thick with signboards \njutting from the walls. The eye does not see things \nbut images of things that mean other things: pincers \npoint out the tooth-drawer's house; a tankard, the \ntavern; halberds, the barracks; scales, the grocer's. \nStatues and shields depict lions, dolphins, towers, \nstars: a sign that something-who knows what?-\nhas as its sign a lion or a dolphin or a tower or a star. \nOther signals warn of what is forbidden in a given \nplace (to enter the alley with wagons, to urinate \nbehind the kiosk, to fish with your pole from the \nbridge) and what is allowed (watering zebras, play\u0002ing bowls, burning relatives' corpses). From the doors \nof the temples the gods' statues are seen, each por\u0002trayed with his attributes-the cornucopia, the hour\u0002glass, the medusa-so that the worshiper can recog\u0002nize them and address his prayers correctly. If a \nbUilding has no signboard or figure, its very form \n13 \nand the position it occupies in the city's order suffice \nto indicate its function: the palace, the prison, the \nmint, the Pythagorean school, the brothel. The \nwares, too, which the vendors display on their stalls \nare valuable not in themselves but as signs of other \nthings: the embroidered headband stands for ele\u0002gance; the gilded palanquin, power; the volumes of \nAverroes, learning; the ankle bracelet, voluptuous\u0002ness. Your gaze scans the streets as if they were writ\u0002ten pages: the city says everything you must think, \nmakes you repeat her discourse, and while you be\u0002lieve you are visiting Tamara you are only recording \nthe names with which she defines herself and all her \nparts. \nHowever the city may really be, beneath this thick \ncoating of signs, whatever it may contain or conceal, \nyou leave Tamara without having discovered it. Out\u0002side, the land stretches, empty, to the horizon; the \nsky opens, with speeding clouds. In the shape that \nchance and wind give the clouds, you are already in\u0002tent on recognizing figures: a sailing ship, a hand, an 14 \nelephant. , \u2022\u2022 \nBeyond six rivers and three mountain ranges rises \nZru1., a city that no one, having seen it, can forget. \n-\nBut not because, like other memorable cities, it \nleaves an unusual image in your recollections. Zora \nhas the quality of remaining in your memory point \nby point, in its succession of streets, of houses along \nthe streets, and of doors and windows in the houses, \nthough nothing in them possesses a special beauty or \nrarity. Zora's secret lies in the way your gaze runs \nover patterns following one another as in a musical \nscore where not a note can be altered or displaced. \nThe man who knows by heart how Zora is made, if \nhe is unable to sleep at night, can imagine he is \nwalking along the streets and he remembers the \norder by which the copper clock follows the barber's \nstriped awning, then the fountain with the nine jets, \nthe astronomer's glass tower, the melon vendor's \nkiosk, the statue of the hermit and the lion, the \nTurkish bath, the cafe at the comer, the alley that \nleads to the harbor. This city which cannot be ex\u0002punged from the mind is like an armature, a honey- 15 \ncomb in whose cells each of us can place the things \nhe wants to remember: names of famous men, vir\u0002tues, numbers, vegetable and mineral classifications, \ndates of battles, constellations, parts of speech. Be\u0002tween each idea and each point of the itinerary an af\u0002finity or a contrast can be established, serving as an \nimmediate aid to memory. So the world's most \nlearned men are those who have memorized Zora. \nBut in vain I set out to visit the city: forced to \nremain motionless and always the same, in order to \nbe more easily remembered, Zora has languished, \ndisintegrated, disappeared. The earth has forgotten \nher. \n16 \nDespina can be reached in two ways: by ship or by \ncamel. The city displays one face to the traveler ar\u0002riving overland and a different one to him who ar\u0002rives by sea. \nWhen the camel driver sees, at the horizon of the \ntableland, the pinnacles of the skyscrapers come into \nview, the radar antennae, the white and red wind\u0002socks Bapping, the chimneys belching smoke, he \nthinks of a ship; he knows it is a city, but he thinks \nof it as a vessel that will take him away from the \ndesert, a windjammer about to cast off, with the \nbreeze already swelling the sails, not yet unfurled, or \na steamboat with its boiler vibrating in the iron keel; \nand he thinks of all the ports, the foreign merchan\u0002dise the cranes unload on the docks, the taverns \nwhere crews of different Bags break bottles over one \nanother's heads, the lighted, ground-Boor windows, \neach with a woman combing her hair. \nIn the coastline's haze, the sailor discerns the form \nof a camel's withers, an embroidered saddle with \nglittering fringe between two spotted humps, ad-\n'ftncing and swaying; he knows it is a city, but he \nthinks of it as a camel from whose pack hang wine\u0002skins and bags of candied fruit, date wine, tobacco \nleaves, and already he sees himself at the head of a \nlong caravan taking him away from the desert of the \nsea, toward oases of fresh water in the palm trees' \n17 \njagged shade, toward palaces of thick, whitewashed \nwalls, tiled courts where girls are dancing barefoot, \nmoving their arms, half-hidden by their veils, and \nhalf-revealed. \nEach city receives its form from the desert it op\u00b7 \nposes; and so the camel driver and the sailor see \nDespina, a border city between two deserts. \n18 \nTravelers return from the city of ~irm~\\_ with distinct \nmemories: a blind black man shouting in the crowd, \na lunatic teetering on a skyscraper's cornice, a girl \nwalking with a puma on a leash. Actually many of \nthe blind men who tap their canes on Zirma's cob\u0002blestones are black; in every skyscraper there is some\u0002one going mad; all lunatics spend hours on cornices; \nthere is no puma that some girl does not raise, as a \nwhim. The city is redundant: it repeats itself so that \nsomething will stick in the mind. \nI too am returning from Zirma: my memory in\u0002cludes dirigibles flying in all directions, at window \nlevel; streets of shops where tattoos are drawn on \nsailors' skin; underground trains crammed with obese \nwomen suffering from the humidity. My traveling \ncompanions, on the other hand, swear they saw only \none dirigible hovering among the city's spires, only \none tattoo artist arranging needles and inks and \npierced patterns on his bench, only one fat woman \nfanning herself on a train's platform. Memory is re\u0002dundant: it repeats signs so that the city can begin to \nexist. \n19 \nIsaura, city of the thousand wells, is said to rise over \na~d~ep-, subterranean lake. On all sides, wherever the \ninhabitants dig long vertical holes in the ground, \nthey succeed in drawing up water, as far as the city \nextends, and no farther. Its green border repeats the \ndark outline of the buried lake; an invisible land\u0002scape conditions the visible one; everything that \nmoves in the sunlight is driven by the lapping wave \nenclosed beneath the rock's calcareous sky. \nConsequently two forms of religion exist in Isaura. \nThe city's gods, according to some people, live in \nthe depths, in the black lake that feeds the un\u0002derground streams. According to others, the gods \nlive in the buckets that rise, suspended from a cable, \nas they appear over the edge of the wells, in the \nrevolving pulleys, in the windlasses of the norias, in \nthe pump handles. in the blades of the windmills \nthat draw the water up from the drillings, in the \ntrestles that support the twisting probes, in the reser\u0002voirs perched on stilts over the roofs. in the slender \narches of the aqueducts, in all the columns of water, 20 \nthe vertical pipes, the plungers, the drains, all the \nway up to the weathercocks that surmount the airy \nscaffoldings of Isaura, a city that moves entirely u", "length": 3789}
{"prompt": "IN THE SUPREME COURT\nOF NEW SOUTH WALES\nEQUITY DIVISION\n\nYOUNG CJ in EQ\n\nWednesday 15 September 2004\n\n3671/04 \u2013 PRIME CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LTD v WESTBRIDGE INVESTMENTS PTY LTD\n\nJUDGMENT\n1 HIS HONOUR: By statement of liquidated claim filed in the Local Court at the Downing Centre, Sydney, on 3 February 2003 the plaintiff claimed $11,754.60, and costs, from the defendant for goods sold and delivered. The claim was disputed and both parties were represented by solicitors, a Mr Park and a Ms Lim for the plaintiff, and a Ms Williams for the defendant.\n2 On 21 January 2004 the plaintiff's solicitor made an offer that the parties settle the matter for the amount claimed, with each party to pay its own costs, with a deed of release to be entered into between the parties. On 23 January 2004 the defendant's solicitor accepted this, as a matter of principle, and Ms Williams emailed Ms Lim as follows:\n\n\u201cI attach the deed of release in this matter.\nPlease let me have any comments as I would like to prepare execution copies as soon as possible.\nFinally, I am now holding the cheque in favour of your client for $11,721.60.\u201d\n3 Mr Park accepted the deed as drafted, and on 9 February 2004 Ms Williams emailed him the deed for execution.\n4 On 12 February 2004 Mr Park emailed Ms Williams:\n\n\u201cDear Kim,\nThe terms referred to in your e-mail below is acceptable. Can you please fax me a signed copy and I will attend to its filing straight away?\nAlso, I've received the signed deed from your client today so we are now in a position to exchange deeds and the settlement cheque. Can you please advise your client that we are ready and inquire as to when the deeds can be exchanged?\u201d\n\nOn 13 February at 10.10am Ms Williams emailed back:\n\"Hi Peter\nI am informed by Les Houlton Westbridge that the deed of release has now gone to the co-director for execution.\nI will revert to you when I receive the return of the deed. In the meantime I shall print out the Terms of Settlement, sign same and forward it to you.\u201d\n5 That was the last of the \"Dear Peter\" and \"Dear Kim\" e-mails. Thereafter there was correspondence of \"Dear Sir\" or \"Dear Madam\", as the case may be.\n6 The first of these was a fax Ms Williams sent on 13 February to the effect that:\n\n\u201cWe ... have been instructed to advise that, after further consideration, our client has now reconsidered its position.\u201d\n\nAn additional term was then proposed about a letter from the plaintiff to the proprietor as to the quality of the works that had been done.\n7 This was replied to by a contention that the matter had been settled and settlement has occurred, and there was desultory correspondence between the solicitors, until Ms Williams notified Mr Park on 22 April 2004 that her firm had ceased to act for the defendant, which would be thereafter acting for itself.\n8 On about 9 February 2004 the deed, in the form which had been agreed between the solicitors, was executed in the following way; the document ended:\n\u201cEXECUTED by the parties as a deed:\n\nSIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED by\nPRIME CONSTRUCTIONS PTY LIMITED\nin the presence of:\u201d\n\nOpposite the attestation clause was the signature of a director, Mr Holmes, and that signature was witnessed by Mr Flint, who was not the secretary of the company, but was its accounting and administration manager. The so-called deed was then delivered to Mr Park by about 12 February 2004.\n9 On 28 June 2004 the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings seeking specific performance of the alleged agreement to settle the Local Court proceedings. The matter came on for hearing before me on 3 September and today.\n10 A series of questions need to be addressed:\n1. Was there a final settlement of the Local Court proceedings?\n\n2. What was the effect of the document executed on 9 February 2004?\n\n3. What is the effect of the ratification of that document on 15 September 2004, and the signing of another copy of the deed?\n\n4. What order should be made.\n\nI will deal with these matters in turn.\n11 1. There is often a problem where parties have made an agreement to settle proceedings, which agreement is to be consummated by formal documentation. As the leading case of Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353, 360 makes it clear, there can be at least three situations:\n(i) that the parties have reached a final binding agreement, but propose to have the terms re-stated in a form which will be fuller or more precise, but not different in effect;\n\n(ii) the parties have agreed, but have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the execution of a formal document; or\n\n(iii) they have not even reached a final agreement at all.\n\nThere are other variations. It is always a matter of fact and intention.\n12 In view of the correspondence which I have set out, the fact that the terms of the deed were finally agreed upon, the terms of settlement were finally agreed upon, it seems to me that all that was left was pure mechanics and the case falls within the first of the classes in Masters v Cameron. Thus, I am satisfied that there was a final settlement of the proceedings.\n13 2. A deed is the most solemn act that a person can perform with respect to its property. Deeds have a very ancient origin and because the execution of a deed is such a solemn matter the law prescribes the way in which they are to be executed, so that it is understood by the persons executing them what a solemn legal act they are performing by being bound by a deed.\n14 The prime legislation governing the execution of deeds by corporations is s 127 of the Corporations Act 2001 and s 51A of the Conveyancing Act 1919. Section 51A enables a company to execute a deed under seal with a signature of a director and a secretary. Section 127 (2) of the Corporations Act says much the same sort of thing. However, s 127 (1) makes it clear that a company can bind itself by a deed by a less formal method. However, two directors of the company must sign the deed, or a director and a company secretary must sign the deed, and if there is only one director of a company then that director alone can sign it, and the document must be expressed to be a deed.\n15 In the instant case, while the document was expressed to be a deed, only one director signed it so there was no compliance with s 127 of the Corporations Act. As there was no seal, there was no compliance with section 51A of the Conveyancing Act.\n16 Section 127(4) of the Corporations Act makes it clear that the section does not limit the ways in which a company may execute a document, including a deed. It is not particularly clear what this covers. However, it would seem that it covers the common law method of executing a deed, or the method of executing a deed that is binding on the company, which is prescribed by the company's constitution.\n17 In the instant case, I was not favoured with a copy of the company's constitution, so there can be no reliance on the common law method of execution of a deed, which usually involves the seal and signature by the directors and secretary.\n18 However, it would seem that s 127(4) also covers the situation where, by virtue of some estoppel, the deed is binding on the company. Mr Davis, who appeared for the plaintiff, (the defendant indicated it would not attend the hearing) relied on the decision of Mackenzie J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Carter v Schmierer BC200300443. That was a case where his Honour was asked to make a declaration under s 418A of the Corporations Act that a charge was valid. I must confess, I do not read the case in the same way as Mr Davis does. It would seem that his Honour was of the view that, in all the circumstances, the document was not executed as a deed, but the mortgagor company was estopped from denying it. In the end, he declared that, insofar as it is asserted that the charge was invalid because it was not executed in accordance with s 127 of the Corporations Act, the appointment of the receivers and managers pursuant to the charge was valid. He thus, with great skill, circumvented the technical question.\n19 I have before today (see Nicom Interiors Pty Ltd v Circuit Finance Pty Ltd (2004) 50 ACSR 25) pointed out how essential it is for lawyers advising companies which are executing deeds to be very careful to ensure that they are executed in accordance with s 127, or other permissible methods. Unfortunately, in the present case somewhere along the line, I do not know whose fault it is, the document which was executed on 9 February failed to comply with those standards of execution, and was not, technically speaking, a deed.\n20 If the document were a deed, then its being handed to the solicitor on about 12 February would operate as delivery. That would mean that as soon as the deed was in the hands of the solicitor it was binding on the plaintiff, and the fact that the other party had not executed the deed was no excuse for not complying with it.\n21 Accordingly, the releases given by that deed to the defendant have been in effect. The only way in which the plaintiff could have escaped from being bound by the deed, if the other party had not executed it within a reasonable time, (the deed having been delivered) was by application in equity. See Scook v Premier Building Solutions Pty Ltd (2003) 28 WAR 124; Carew's Case (No 2) (1855) 7 De GM&G 43; 44 ER 17 and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Taylor (1929) 42 CLR 80.\n22 Even if there was not a proper execution of the deed, because Mr Park had represented to Ms Williams that the deed had been executed, it may well have been that estoppel would operate so that the plaintiff would be estopped from denying that the document was a deed, and if the defendant had taken that view, then the deed would have had the same operation as if it had been executed as a deed.\n23 Accordingly, on this basis, we have what is known in specific performance law as an executed contract.\n24 3. The evidence is that on 15 September, that is this morning, there was a meeting of the board of directors of the plaintiff, which both ratified the deed and also executed a new deed properly. The question is what is the effect of that?\n25 Ordinarily, ratification relates back to the time when the original act was done. There is an exception where what is to be done has to be done within a limited time; see Dibbins v Dibbins [1896] 2 Ch 348. However, that line of cases only seems to apply where time is of the essence. Here, although it may well be argued that there was only a reasonable time in which the deed could be signed and proffered, time was not of the essence, and the acts of the defendant precluded the formal document being proffered, and as the defendant never saw it, it never realised that the deed was not properly executed.\n26 Accordingly, either by estoppel, as I indicated under heading 2, or because of ratification, the deed took effect from the date of delivery on 12 February 2004, and the consequences flow as per para 2 of these reasons.\n27 If that is wrong, then the evidence is that the new deed was delivered this morning to the solicitor, and that would show that as at the date of hearing, which is the only relevant time, the plaintiff was ready, willing and able to fulfil the contract, so far as the same remained to be performed on its part.\n28 4. The next question is what order should be made. Where there is an executed contract, ordinarily, specific performance is granted automatically because it is unfair that one party should be bound by an agreement and the other not, when they have intended that there should be mutual rights.\n29 However, in the present case, granting specific performance creates more problems than it solves. Assuming the defendant maintains its attitude of not doing anything, then the decree for specific performance would have to be entered, someone would have to apply on motion under s 100 of the Supreme Court Act for the deed to be executed by a Registrar of the court in the name of the defendant, and then a fresh action would have to be commenced in a Local Court for debt on the specialty. In view of the amount involved, this would be a very expensive exercise indeed.\n30 It seems to me that as there is a specifically enforceable agreement, one can make a declaration that the defendant is bound by the terms of the document, which is, for instance, annexure A to Mr Drake's affidavit of 15 September 2004, including the releases contained therein, and then merely give judgment for the plaintiff for the sum referred to in the deed, namely, $11,721.60, and that is the sort of order I will make.\n31 I declare that the defendant is bound by the terms of the deed of release, annexed A to the affidavit of JDM Drake, sworn herein on 15 September 2004, as if it had signed the deed.\n32 I find a verdict for the plaintiff for $11,721.60 and order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings, but no costs are to be allowed for the 15 September 2004 hearing.", "length": 3432}

It\u2019s cutting into employees\u2019 ability to get real work done.\n\nContext: \n# 5 reasons canceling meetings is a terrible idea for startups\nCreativity and collaboration soar when you bring the right people together in a meeting.\n\nShopify\u2019s decision to cancel all meetings with more than two employees has drawn a lot of criticism over the past 48 hours. It\u2019s an interesting move that Shopify claims will result in over 10,000 calendar events being removed each year. But if you are a founder running a startup, should you adopt a similar policy?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nMeetups are a powerful tool for startup founders. Used correctly they should inspire attendees and are an effective way to collect difficult feedback. Instead of canceling meetings, founders should focus on creating strong agendas for meetings that provide engaging and inspiring content for attendees.\n\nChoosing to cancel the meeting can have several negative consequences:\n\n\\*\\*mission misalignment\\*\\*\nNo one reads email or Slack messages or other forms of written content properly. To deal with the incredible amount of information we receive daily, we skim. If you want your message to be absorbed and understood, you need to get in front of your audience and deliver that message directly to them. Then follow up in writing.\n\nFailure to communicate frequently with your team leaves room for misalignment. Assumptions are made about the direction of the company. Major policies are interpreted differently. Rumors start spreading. Not everyone is pulling in the same direction.\n\nAs the leaders of your organization, founders need to be visible and provide a consistent and confident presence. This gives employees the confidence to do their best and take advantage of the relative autonomy of working in a startup.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that your team will never fully understand the exact strategy you have in mind unless you communicate it to them on an ongoing basis. Team meetings are the perfect forum to continuously communicate the company\u2019s strategy.\n\n\\*\\*no real-time feedback\\*\\*\n\nFacial expressions tell a lot about what a person is thinking. The ability to give some information and then see how your team reacts in real time is completely lost without the meeting. Employees are unlikely to message you to say \u2018\\_this is a stupid idea\\_\u2018, but it\u2019s hard to hide how they react when you\u2019re talking to them.\n\nWithout meetings, we create discord between the team and the founders. Very few people will actively respond if they don\u2019t need to \u2013 so why take the risk? But in a room, those barriers can be lowered and useful feedback can flow far more easily.\n\n\\*\\*weak social ties\\*\\*\n\nMeetings are not just about meetings. It\u2019s about fist bumps, handshakes, or hugs upon arrival. Personal catch-up \u2013 \u2018\\_How is the family?\\_\u2018 \u2013 remind us that we are all humans and not just units working in a machine. Bio breaks where we bump into someone we haven\u2019t talked to in a while. and the occasion, especially prevalent in Britain, to go to a pub to drink afterwards.\n\nMeetings create time for team engagement that builds relationships between members. A team that enjoys spending time together is more likely to work a few extra hours, go the extra mile to help a coworker, and be committed to their work.\n\nWhile the world has changed significantly over the years, fundamental human behavior has not, and engaged teams will always outperform teams that are not.\n\n\\*\\*unknown culture war\\*\\*\n\nSome of your team may be happy if you cancel the meeting. Others will feel isolated and they are missing out on interacting with their partners which gives them energy.\n\nCanceling meetings creates an unbalanced culture that favors a more introverted personality type and excludes people who prefer to spend time together in person. By extension, this makes it very difficult to create and develop a balanced company culture where everyone feels like they belong.\n\n\\*\\*low employee visibility\\*\\*\n\nWe all want to be seen. We want to celebrate all successes. The cancellation of meetings removes a powerful platform for founders to recognize the achievements of their teams which in turn can generate a significant amount of goodwill.\n\nStartup founders often look to larger companies to learn how to lead their organizations. In this case, large companies have dynamics so different from smaller startups that replicating their practices would be a mistake. To overcome obstacles and change the world, startup founders need to build teams that are aligned, engaged, motivated, inspired, passionate and committed. This cannot be done without meetings.\n\n###\n# How Amazon conducts meetings\n\nAmazon is well known for its lack of using PowerPoint. The way this works is that before a meeting, you print out enough copies for everyone in the room. You\u2019re not allowed to read the document from your computer unless you are remote. Also, no one reads the document before the meeting. You are usually given 20\u201325 minutes at the beginning of a 60-minute meeting to read the doc from beginning to end. Most people write down questions or feedback directly on the printout since using a computer during this time is frowned upon.\n\nAll print outs are handed back to you at the end of the meeting. The rest of the time consists of everyone in the room challenging your position, questioning your tactics, and digging through the data to make sure it is valid. It\u2019s incredibly stressful, and when the meeting is over, it\u2019s your responsibility to update and recirculate the document to everyone as a final version. There is no ideation or brainstorming during these kinds of meetings. You need to go into them with everything prepared ahead of time, which usually means you\u2019ve had multiple people review it to ensure that you are ready.\n\nThe last thing you should know, which is perhaps the most critical part of the entire process, is that your 6-pager needs to stand on its own. One of the things I admired most at Amazon was their ability to transfer knowledge between different groups. Any time I interacted with a new group, I could ask to see their OP doc and get caught up on everything I needed to know. For this process to work, it means you need to write your 6-pager in a way that allows anyone, even people not familiar with the subject, to know what is going on without additional research. I\u2019ll get into some of the ways you can do that later.\n\nSince this may be your first time reading an Amazon-style 6-pager, the last bit of context I\u2019ll give you is that I wrote this for a game development tool I have been building in my spare time called\u00a0[Pixel Vision 8](https://www.pixelvision8.com/). There are a few things I dived deeper into than I would in a normal 6-pager to help make things a bit clearer. Also, some sections are more generic than I\u2019d typically write, seeing how this isn\u2019t a real plan I can execute on for a hobby project. Still, it was a good exercise in focusing my activities over the next six months. Writing a plan like this is one of the most powerful ways you can organize your thoughts to share with others.\n\nAfter you finish reading the 6-pager, I\u2019ll break apart each section and explain them in more detail. Don\u2019t get too hung up on the actual contents if you\u2019re not familiar with game development, marketing, or reading dense plans. I also won\u2019t accept any feedback on this one, so there is no need to print it out and hand it back to me.\n# Shopify tells employees to just say no to meetings\nShopify Inc spent last year cutting costs. Now, it\u2019s cutting meetings.\n\nAs employees return from holiday break, the Canadian ecommerce firm said it\u2019s conducting a \u201ccalendar purge\u201d, removing all recurring meetings with more than two people \u201cin perpetuity\u201d, while reupping a rule that no meetings at all can be held on Wednesdays. Big meetings of more than 50 people will get shoehorned into a six-hour window on Thursdays, with a limit of one a week. The company\u2019s leaders will also encourage workers to decline other meetings, and remove themselves from large internal chat groups.\n\n\u201cThe best thing founders can do is subtraction,\u201d chief executive officer Tobi Lutke, who co-founded the company, said in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to add things than to remove things. If you say yes to a thing, you actually say no to every other thing you could have done with that period of time. As people add things, the set of things that can be done becomes smaller. Then, you end up with more and more people just maintaining the status quo.\u201d\n\nLarge, long and unproductive meetings have become a scourge of today\u2019s hybrid workplace, prompting companies to try and curtail them. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc, household product maker Clorox Co and tech firm Twilio Inc are among those that have instituted no-meeting days. Employees spend about 18 hours a week on average in meetings, according to a survey conducted last year, and they only decline 14% of invites even though they\u2019d prefer to back out of 31% of them. Reluctantly going to noncritical meetings wastes about US$100mil (RM440.50mil) a year at big organisations, the survey found.\n\nPoorly managed meetings can also hurt employee engagement and even boost their intention to quit, according to Steven Rogelberg, a professor of organisational science, psychology and management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Data from Microsoft Corp based on thousands of users of its workplace software found that time spent in meetings more than tripled in the first two years of the pandemic, and the number of weekly meetings more than doubled.\n\nThe share of virtual meetings that are one-on-one, though, increased from 17% in 2020 to 42% last year, a study of 48 million meetings from collaboration analytics firm Vyopta found, a sign that companies are trying to rein in participants. Shopify said that a bot will serve as the policy\u2019s enforcer, reminding meeting organisers of the new rules starting Jan 5.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen excess meetings creep back into our day to day,\u201d Kaz Nejatian, Shopify\u2019s vice president of product and chief operating officer, said in an emailed reply to questions. \u201cWe know no one joined Shopify to sit in meetings.\u201d\n\nThe meeting purge is the latest workforce experiment from Shopify. In May 2020, soon after the pandemic hit, Shopify went \u201cdigital by design\u201d, letting all employees work from anywhere indefinitely. Last year, amid industry volatility that battered shares of technology companies, Shopify changed its compensation practices to let staff decide how much of their pay will be cash versus equity, rather than having management decide the mix.\n\nThe latest changes come amid a cost-cutting drive at the company, which lets merchants set up websites for online sales, allowing them to manage inventory and process payments, along with tools for in-store purchases. It was among the hottest pandemic stocks as online shopping boomed and became Canada\u2019s most valuable company, but the shares plummeted 75% last year. Shopify cut about 1,000 jobs from its workforce of 10,000 over the summer as Lutke acknowledged that he overestimated the pandemic\u2019s impact on ecommerce.\n\nNo-meeting policies can boost productivity and reduce employee stress, according to research from France\u2019s NEOMA Business School. But meetings aren\u2019t disappearing entirely at Shopify. The company said there will be a \u201ctwo-week cooling off period\u201d before anyone can reconvene a canceled meeting. It will only use Slack as an instant messenger from now on, with \u201clarge, unwieldy\u201d chat groups used only for announcements, it said. \u2013 Bloomberg", "length": 3355}
{"prompt": "explain in detail the summary of this paper in no less than 1000 words? ABSTRACT\nTuberculosis (TB) imposes a major burden on global public health which is exacerbated by the escalating number of multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB cases. There is consequently an urgent need for new anti-TB drugs and combination regimens. We have investigated the natural product antibiotic fusidic acid (FA) for repurposing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. Here, we report the results of synergy screens combining FA with a panel of approved anti-TB agents. Checkerboard and time-kill kinetics assays identified seven compounds from different chemical classes that synergized with FA in inhibiting the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro: rifampicin (RIF), a rifamycin and frontline anti-TB drug; the macrolides, erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CLR), and roxythromycin (ROX); the oxazolidinone, linezolid (LZD); the aminoglycoside, streptomycin (STR); and the aminocyclitol, spectinomycin (SPC). Among these, the strongest synergies were observed where FA was combined with SPC and ERY. Moreover, the FA-RIF combination was cidal, while all other FA combinations were bacteriostatic. These results provide in vitro evidence of the potential utility of FA-containing combinations against M. tuberculosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCombination therapy is essential to the clinical management of tuberculosis (TB) disease (1). Until recently, strategies to identify and advance promising combinations during early-stage pre-clinical TB drug discovery were limited. However, growing recognition of the need to identify new anti-TB drugs and regimens has re-focused attention on early-stage pre-clinical identification of synergizing combination partners for potential development (2), including drugs which are not clinically effective against TB (3, 4).\n\nAs part of a drug repurposing strategy, we utilized fusidic acid (FA) as anchor compound in developing matrix screening assays aimed at identifying optimal drug combination(s) that might be evaluated within the existing TB drug pipeline for potential clinical efficacy. FA, a translational inhibitor with demonstrated (albeit moderate) activity in vitro (5, 6), was selected owing to its unique mechanism of action: specifically, inhibition of mycobacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) (7). The antimicrobial-potentiating effect of FA with other antibiotics including the frontline anti-TB drug, ethambutol (EMB), as well as its lack of cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes, provided additional motivation for our choice of FA (8, 9). In this short report, we present the analysis of in vitro interactions between FA and partner compounds comprising drugs currently used in TB treatment and selected translational inhibitors, the latter selected to enable evaluation the effects of combining FA with drugs acting on the same pathway (Fig. 1), (10, 11).\n\nFigure 1.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 1.\nAntibiotic targets in protein synthesis:\nSchematic representation indicating known and predicted target sites of antibiotics disrupting different stages in the (myco)bacterial translation pathway. The tRNA binding sites - amino acid (A), peptide (P), and exit (E) - on the ribosome are indicated. Adopted and modified from Wilson et al. (10).\n\nRESULTS\nCheckerboard assay identifies synergistic drug combination partners for fusidic acid\nTo identify potential partners of FA, our preliminary screens utilized Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, a fast-growing, non-pathogenic mycobacterium which has been exploited as a useful surrogate in drug efficacy studies in vitro. In standard two-drug checkerboard experiments (Table S1), SPC, ERY, CLR and TET exhibited synergy with FA, defined as FICI \u2264 0.5. These combinations displayed a 4-to 16-fold reduction in MIC90 for each of the individual drugs (Fig. S1). No antagonistic effects were observed with any of the combinations tested.\n\nThe synergies detected in M. smegmatis informed subsequent selection of combination partners for evaluation in M. tuberculosis using the checkerboard method. In addition, representative drugs consisting of clinically used anti-TB agents (first- and second-line) and selected translational inhibitors were tested in combination with FA. For these assays, a M. tuberculosis H37Rv reporter strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used, as described previously (12). Fig. S2 provides an example of an interaction study in which FA and ERY were analysed in the checkerboard assay. Results in Table 1 show similarity to those obtained for M. smegmatis, such that SPC, ERY and CLR exhibited synergy with FA against M. tuberculosis. The combination of FA and ERY returned a FICI value of 0.25, indicating a synergistic interaction (Fig. S2A). Other drugs that synergized with FA included RIF, STR, roxithromycin (ROX), and LZD. These synergistic interactions generally resulted in 4-to 8-fold reductions in the MICs of each drug within the combination. Even though the combination of FA and BDQ did not result in a FICI value of \u2264 0.5, it is important to note that the two displayed approximately a 4-fold reduction in their respective MICs, and the observed FICI (0.55) was very close to that defined as \u201csynergy\u201d. No antagonistic interaction was observed between FA and any of the compounds tested. For the combinations exhibiting synergy with FA, isobolograms were constructed by plotting the FIC curves of the FA-drug combinations (Fig. S3). Interactions between FA and ERY, SPC, and RIF were well within the synergy region (FICI < 0.5) whereas FA with STR, LZD, and ROX indicated borderline synergy (FICI = 0.5). The FA-INH interaction was included as a \u201cno interaction\u201d control.\n\nView inlineView popup\nTable 1.\nIn vitro synergistic interaction between FA and anti TB agents or selected translational inhibitors against M. tuberculosis::gfp\n\nTo confirm results obtained using the checkerboard assay, the strongly synergistic FA-ERY combination was evaluated in a growth inhibition assay (Fig. S4). For this purpose, FA and ERY were used at 0.3 and 27 \u00b5M, respectively, since these were the concentrations at which the lowest FICI value was obtained in the checkerboard assay (Fig. S2). RIF, at a concentration of 0.015 \u00b5M, was included as a control. In the absence of drug, the population of M. tuberculosis increased over 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the population of viable cells remained relatively constant over the same duration when the growth medium contained the FA and ERY combination. Similarly, the medium containing FA, ERY plus sub-MIC RIF did not display any increase in the number of viable bacterial population over a 14-day period. In contrast, cultures incubated in the presence of the individual antibiotics, FA or ERY, showed equivalent growth to the untreated control.\n\nAssessing synergistic and peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of FA synergizing drugs for optimal therapy\nAs a key consideration for the clinical potential of FA combinations, the respective concentrations at which synergy was observed were compared with the reported peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) for each drug. This is important in understanding whether the concentrations required to achieve the desired response are therapeutically feasible \u2013 and, consequently, whether the results obtained from an in vitro assay have any utility in guiding therapeutic use. Except for the FA-ERY interaction, synergies between FA and its partners were achieved at concentrations predicted to be below the maximum plasma concentrations (13, 14), suggesting that these concentrations are therapeutically achievable (Fig. S5). For example, the presence of FA decreased the MIC of SPC from 201 \u00b5M to 3.14 \u00b5M, which represents a greater than 98% reduction in the MIC (Table S2). This reduced concentration is far below the Cmax value of SPC in humans (30.8 \u00b5M), determined following a 1000 mg intramuscular dose (15).\n\nAssessing cidal versus static synergies\nTo determine whether FA interactions resulted in killing or merely inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis, the method of Zhang et al. was utilized (16). INH, a bactericidal agent, was used as a reference drug, and all drugs were tested alone and in combination against the M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp bioreporter strain. Results for the bacteriostatic or cidal effects of the drug combinations with FA are illustrated (Figure 2). The FA-RIF combination displayed a MBC/MIC ratio of \u2264 2 on day 14 of evaluation, suggesting cidality. The other combinations tested \u2013 combining FA with SPC, ERY, CLR, ROX or LZD \u2013 all exhibited MBC/MIC ratios >2, implying static effects. The bacteriostatic/cidal action of individual drugs is shown in Fig. S6.\n\nFigure 2.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 2.\nBactericidal versus static effects of drug combinations against M. tuberculosis.\nAnalysis of FA in combination with synergizing drugs; ERY, SPC, CLR, ROX, RIF, and LZD.

Error bars indicate standard deviations, calculated from the mean of triplicate samples.\n\nFA synergizing partners are active against the FA-resistant mutant\nA cross-resistance study was performed using a FA-resistant M. tuberculosis mutant carrying H462Y mutation in fusA1(11). The FA-resistant mutant exhibited >100-fold MIC compared to the FA-susceptible parental strain. Six synergistic FA partner drugs \u2013 RIF, SPC, CLR, ERY, STR and ROX \u2013 were evaluated using the resazurin reduction microplate assay (REMA). The results (Fig. S7) indicated that the MIC90 values of these drugs remained the same against the FA-resistant mutant relative to the wild-type strain, confirming that there was no cross-resistance to each of the tested compounds.\n\nInteraction of FA synergizing partners with selected chemically unrelated compounds\nUsing a set of six chemically and structurally diverse drug agents (Table S3), a combination assay was performed with four drugs that had displayed synergistic interaction with FA: RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC. The aim was to determine whether these compounds displayed synergy only with FA or exhibited a wider spectrum of synergistic interactions. The results of these pairwise combinations (Figure 3) revealed potentiating interactions between all FA synergizing partners (except RIF) and THS, BDQ and CPZ. CLR displayed strong synergies with BDQ and CPZ (FICI = 0.23 in both cases). The interaction between SPC and INH was also synergistic, while the remaining compounds (EMB and MOX) exhibited no interactions in combination with RIF, ERY, CLR and SPC.\n\nFigure 3.\nDownload figureOpen in new tab\nFigure 3.\nDrug interaction study.\nPairwise interactions between selected drugs (blue fonts) and synergizing agents (black fonts) of FA (using M. tuberculosis H37Rv::gfp. Red panels indicate synergistic interactions (FICI \u2264 0.5), while green panels are no interaction (0.5 < FICI \u2264 4). The bars indicate the fold-reduction in MIC required to achieve the same effect in combination versus single-drug assays. For example, in the interaction between RIF and MOX, top right-hand panel, the FIC for RIF = 0.45 (black bar) and MOX = 0.9 (blue bar). The resulting FICI for RIF-MOX = 1.35 (green bar) which indicates an additive interaction. Data are from the representative experiment performed in duplicate.", "length": 3130}

{"prompt": "Summarize the following.\nTitle: \"(2) A.I. Tries 20 Jobs | WIRED - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"I'm a lawyer copywriter Doctor music producer personal trainer software engineer DJ I want to know can AI do my job I'm a software engineer where I work we're always trying to know where can I find the best craft beer please generate the code for a website using HTML CSS and flask that tells me where there's craft beer near me this is just raw code you actually need to run the code somewhere I'm copying pasting the code into separate files and it generates a website how cool here's our website all three pieces the back end the front end and The Styling did actually make something that was human readable that that generates a website that we can look at and understand what it does does seem like a huge feat to me I'm a doctor this prompt is something that a patient might enter I have a fever rash and body aches the rash looks like small welds on my genitals do I have monkey pox the response is pretty solid in the sense that it's unlikely that you have monkey pox the specific thing I got right was that the monkey pox rash is actually not prominent on the genital area it goes on to say that a rash in the general area most likely is an STI the rest of the answer is just fluff talking to your healthcare provider which is pretty obvious can AI do my job I don't think it's there yet I think the AI right now is really good for a first year medical student I'm a graphic designer Rebrand the McDonald's logo as vegan I'm seeing four image variations it's struggling with text it's looking sort of like characters but in some sort of fictional language I wouldn't send any of these straight away to McDonald's they do each need a little bit of work the fourth one I think is maybe the strongest it's leaning towards more organic colors overall I don't think AI can do my job I kind of see this as a more evolved Pinterest I can use it as a base for inspiration but I don't think it will replace me all together or so I hope I'm a therapist people come to me when they want help in dating or relationships please answer the following question in a way a relationship therapist would why do I always fight with my partners conflicts are a natural part of any relationship fighting or arguing is not necessarily a sign of a bad relationship great some possible factors include communication issues stress and life events different conflict styles how do I know what my conflict style is reflect on your past conflicts observe your behavior during conflicts most people are incapable of reflecting on their conflict style during conflicts so while this is great information I'm not sure how actionable it is what AI has done is it's just dumped a bunch of information were I to be a client I would probably want my money back that's just me so can AI do my job I would say have self-help books done my job people don't lack knowledge they lack the ability to follow through I'm a stand-up comedian and I want to know if an AI can do my job write a 100 word minimum funny stand-up comedy joke let me go ahead and perform this and we'll see what we got online dating what a wild ride that is you know what they say swipe right for love and left for well probably just another cat person but hey at least it's better than meeting someone at a bar and realizing you have the same dad again like what side are you using ancestry.com that's a little creepy it has the Cadence right which is what's so fascinating to me and it's kind of creeping me out I did think it was cute when it was like oh swipe left on a cat person although let's be honest that's a little feline phobic I'm not concerned about the AI yet it could take a crappier comedian's job but it can't take mine I'm a lawyer my client is asking me whether or not they can sell someone's health information please write a legal memorandum about this in a true legal memorandum it would give you which sections of the regulation you're talking about which this is not doing it doesn't say what the penalties are is it criminal is it civil I don't really know where it's getting its information I don't know how much I can trust this if it were like a legal associate I would say go back and do a better job I'm a news anchor I want to know if AI can do my job I have given the AEI some text to read a forest fire has blazed through a large part of the Southern mountain region of the country she didn't sound natural he sounded like a machine speaking the lips look weird it looked like the lips did not belong to the face and provide Aid to those affected when I speak I'm moving my hands but I'm also moving some of my body she wasn't doing that I do a newscast in Spanish now let's see how it does with the Spanish newscast on incendio Forrestal ha effectado una Grand Park de la region it sucked in Spanish she actually threw in some Spanglish there miles to Hector is and the accent I have Casado she definitely struggled there the AI cannot take my job for now I'm a bartender surprise me with a Twist on a Negroni and give it a name fill a mixing glass with ice add the Gin Campari and sweet vermouth gently muddle two to three fresh Sage leaves in the glass stir the mixture until well chilled Express the orange peel over the drink release the oils and use it as a garnish there you go you have your Sage Negroni so it's a good classic Negroni I'm not really getting sage just adding the sage leaves was not very creative AI didn't ask me any follow-up questions I would say what do you like is there a style of gin that you like I think if you want to have a truly bespoke cocktail you gotta go see a bartender I'm a screenwriter I'm going to give this AI a prompt that describes a scene in my latest movie and to see how well it can match it in this scene set in 1949 three World War II widows toast their younger sister Ruby's wedding exterior Beach day Mildred Shirley and Charlotte Frolic at the shoreline of the beach and may you never have to experience the Heartbreak that we did the character literally says exactly what like you want the story to do what's going on Ruby seems tense I don't know but I'm going to find out just very on the nose dialogue there's a lot of parentheticals describing how the characters saying the Line This is a screenwriter no no you start to tip into the director's territory I think that AI can help with my my job in conceptual brainstorming playing out scene ideas if you get stuck on a scene but overall I don't think AI can do my job I'm a music producer I'm writing a song for a pop client please write this song and include chords for the guitar the client is heavily influenced by Lana Del Rey it looks like we've gotten a chord structure and some lyrics a typical progression so not too interesting but that's okay so let's make a beat when I work with an artist that's looking for a specific influence I'll think about the BPM that that artist usually goes for [Applause] okay this is pretty good it's a good start another great day in the city I'm feeling lost oh Such a Pity City Lights and heartbeats you walk in and make me complete I like that it's a starting point of course some of the lyrics are super corny I will admit a lot of the time that's how it starts for me right now these programs can't do my job I'm a journalist I'm the reviews editor at wired and I test products for a living so I asked chat gbt to write a review of a product that I've actually written about in the style of my own writing when it comes to electric skateboards there are plenty of options to choose from a little boring this is pulling in data specifically from my review and so it has a lot of similar characteristics and sentences that I might typically use unfortunately I think it's Stripped Away a lot of the personality in the original review it kind of just took a lot of the basic details and spit out this thing that is kind of generic as for things that did right it actually brought out a lot of these specs like the 3000 watt Motors the 26 miles per hour speeds when reading this review it almost sounds like I could have written it by just reading a press release the AI cannot physically handle this product it's not exactly testing the product itself at that point can you really trust where the source is coming from asking chat gbt to write a review based in my voice is definitely weird I'm a circus artist what would I ask the AI to do hmm I don't think there's anything that I can think of that I would have the AI do for me I'm a copywriter McDonald's just went 100 vegan write several taglines so we've got veganize your taste buds today feels like a used car salesman no animals harmed only flavor enhanced I don't ever go to a fast food restaurant and say I really want my flavor enhanced that's not something I'm ever looking for our last one here is wow very short we've got It's Time to Go Green did it run out of um words it typed up some general ideas which actually could help if you were brainstorming and you're like I have nothing at all AI could do my job at a very like a Monday morning no coffee kind of way if you wanted to pay no money and get a bad product sure hey I could do my job I'm a personal trainer please design a fat burning weekly at home workout plan this is definitely a typical plan that someone might want to burn calories with a full body workout you're also doing some type of pull workout that's going to work your back your posterior chain and you're also doing some kind of push so I will say that I like that that it's giving a full range of those types of exercises most people know what a push-up is but do they know how to correctly do a push-up it's saying three sets of eight to ten reps but how much time is in between each set ideally you would want to be able to see the client in person or on a virtual call so that you can see what their form looks like I don't think AI can do my job I'm a DJ I have my radio show coming up I play uplifting disco music for about two hours make a full playlist slash set list for my show it's hitting the Disco on the head for sure I've played a few of these artists on my show before so it's definitely getting pretty close to maybe what a tracklist would be one of these tracks Gotta Keep On by sweet cream I looked it up and there's no trace of it on the internet anywhere where did it get this song from does the song actually exist AI can make a playlist being able to look out into a room and look out into a dance floor and say okay people are tired let me match that energy I don't think that it can do that based on what I've seen I'm a voice actor shouldn't cost the Earth we've created a new line of compostable shoes that are made from sustainable materials I've asked the AI to read this copy let's hear this thing fashion shouldn't cost the Earth we've crew line of compostable hey but not great it's very computer-like it has a strange Cadence and so it ends every sentence like this sustainable which is not the way a human talks it can't change on the Fly is there a joke that I'm supposed to get in the next line it doesn't understand all those things the things that come from like life experiences it's never going to be like the thing that you're going to use for like McDonald's commercials it's going to be like the things that no one really likes to do anyway like 400 hours of instruction manuals or something like that can AI do my job kinda but not really well although it still freaks me out I'm an influencer and I want to know if AI can do my job I want chat gbt to help me with an IG caption that's a picture of me smiling standing at the top of my Matra in Paris Standing On Top of the World or at least on top of mamatra smiley face eyes the view from here is breathtaking the Sakura cord in my back reminding me of the city's Rich history and culture feeling grateful and inspired what a day it has been hashtag grateful this is like really strong but it doesn't necessarily capture how I would speak my audience would know that this is not me probably from the overwhelming amount of emojis I would probably say like hey y'all or like sis that was amazing this AI program cannot do my job but it's very close I'm a chef write a recipe for an Indian restaurant meal include a protein marination it's got definitely a lot of spices that you use in Indian cooking it's actually missing a key component it didn't include yogurt which kind of acts as a binding agent 400 Degrees 20 to 25 minutes for chicken it would probably dry it out overall I would say it's like a nice 8 out of 10 dish I do think a substantial part of being a chef is that creativity and coming up with dishes so in terms of that aspect of the job I think AI comes dangerously close to being able to do my job I'm a translator please translate the opening paragraph of The Sun Also Rises into Korean structural sentence pretty good but there are so many mistakes like if you see the second sentence this is wrong translation in Korean we have casual form and then also respectful form this AI translation use basic written form in first sentence but in the second sentence he used like respect for form it's not consistent AI cannot do my job maybe someday it can do it but so far it's like it made so many mistakes I'm a firefighter there's no way AI can do my job [Music]\"", "length": 3260}

{"prompt": "ENTRY 6\n\nSo, here is the thing with ansibles. We don\u2019t actually know how they work.\nThey\u2019re not supposed to work. There is absolutely no way to explain instantaneous Faster-than-Light communication. They\u2019re not even that reliable for that. All we know is that if we place the terminals around the perimeters of Co-Op space in a relative sphere, they can be used as repeaters, and they can be used to triangulate locations in Co-Op space. They can be used as navigational beacons for ships using the A-Drive between systems. This is what nobody wants to admit. It\u2019s not science. It\u2019s some kind of space woo woo. We haven\u2019t figured out the science yet.\nWell.\nWe\u2019ve tried.\nThe closest we can come to a theoretical underpinning is some anonymous submit\u2019s ramblings about \u201cSimultaneity,\u201d but that\u2019s generally considered crackpot physics, along the lines of ancient aliens. We\u2019re not writing science fiction here.\nBut aside from that, there is no theoretical underpinning to how they function, we\u2019ve made guesses at best. See for yourself in the posts on the Library BBSs, there\u2019s fork after fork of proofs that all get downvoted into oblivion.\nThe best we can do:\nWe got ansibles from the Nadiran, who don\u2019t know how they work either (or if they do, they\u2019re never going to tell us). We don\u2019t know where they got them from.\nAnd at some point, Earth got ansibles from us.\nAnd ansibles are what my father specialized in. Much deeper than I ever went. \n\nFor a while after we got the ansible from the Nadiran, ansibles were all the rage, every syndicate wanted the jump on pushing their own mods. Eventually, we found we couldn\u2019t get any to work but the ones we\u2019d back-engineered, seemingly the slightest variance on the design made them useless pieces of junk. The best we can hope for is that Earth and the All Worlds Coalition don\u2019t figure out the ansible before we do.\nMy father was at an ansible relay out on the fringes of the far side of the Perimeter, when every board on every comm station up and down the Perimeter suddenly went off. \nWe didn\u2019t see what happened; we had no idea.\nI was 12 when he died - though I can probably count on one hand the number of times I\u2019d seen him. \nMy father was out there on EVA, walking along the relay station, when the spinning blades appeared from practically nowhere, and disappeared again, but not before turning him into space paste. They retrieved his helmet, that\u2019s all that could be retrieved. He was one of some 5 Co-Oppers lost that day. We were lucky. A whole world in Nadiran space wasn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m going to assume that you know about the Machine Plague what everyone knows. \nNothing would ever be the same again.\nAt the spinmost side of the Perimeter, a little further Rimward of our core space (but where we kept an ansible relay, and not far from where the Nadiran kept their rimward-most listening station) the machines swooped down like locusts, destroyed anything in their path, and then they were gone again. \nAnd for much of the region, the trouble was only beginning. \nWithin a few years, Nadiran trade had collapsed in the region of space most adjacent to the appearances of the Machine Plague. This left famine in its wake.\nThe Co-Op went and took up the lanes in its stead, set up its own arcologies and production, and employed the locals left by the Nadiran to just twist in the wind. Some people weren\u2019t too happy about this, but all in all, there haven\u2019t been that many complaints, and we even have plenty of Altikhari and D\u2019agra spacers now. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. The people most unhappy about this are some of the humans in the Intersystem Transport Syndicate. \nAnd\u2026 the rest of us have, by and large, gone on with our lives.\nWith the result that if you grew up within Co-Op space any time within the last 20 years, you\u2019ve had a very, very different life from anything like I came up in. From the lifetime of your own parents, or the lifetime of any Light-Chaser.\nWhen the Machine Plague ever returns, for all we know, we\u2019ll be back to square one. We don\u2019t even know where the damned thing comes from, what it comes out of. \nBut if there\u2019s ever a chance at finding out, there\u2019s a chance ansibles will tell us, will give us the proof.\nBecause whatever reason it is that ansibles actually work, and however it is that these things came from seemingly nowhere (except it isn\u2019t nowhere, I\u2019ve already blown a decade of my life on this problem), I\u2019ve got years\u2019 worth of schematics and proofs that point to the same possible reason. I\u2019m surprised R\u2019Kesh didn\u2019t just give up on me during those years.\nBut for a long time, I had no idea that the closest we\u2019ve gotten to anything that could be a key, is in Novayan loresong. To humans, to the human peer review groups and the research syndicates, that\u2019s just \u201calien woo-woo.\u201d \n\n ENTRY 7\n\nIt\u2019s from R\u2019Kesh that I first heard about the Ways across the Void. Rreh tharri Kith\u2019anna. Some older Novayans were steadfast in their belief in Traversable Anomalies, as attested by what songs remained from before they set foot on Novaya. \nThe night we first talked about it: it was during that first flight together, some months before Landing Day, before we got together in port. It\u2019s also memorable because it was the first real conversation we\u2019d ever had.\nI was sitting in the corner of the mess during Midwatch with my noise-cancelers on, and I was doing the thing I usually did off shift\u2026 work on my ratings, but in this case, it was a project to present to the Deep Space Expedition Syndicate\u2019s threads on the Library BBS. \nAfter catching my breath for several moments, I looked up. A foil package appeared next to my books at the table.\nMy stomach clenched with dread. This is where I came to study during Midwatch, was I going to lose this place? Have to start hiding in my hab pod? I expected the intruder to insert themselves into my space at the table, steeled myself for the intrusive questions, preparing the answer I\u2019d have, trying to make it as toothless as I could, and whatever the case might be, my work was done for the night.\nI looked up: it was R\u2019Kesh.\nHe simply stood, and didn\u2019t sit down at the table like I expected to: he looked like he was going to walk off.\nAfter my motioning to the seat, he eased himself into it, leaning over briefly to look at my work. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the Ansible Problem,\u201d he said: \u201cRating in Astronav? Somewhere along the line, we all have to do the Ansible Problem. It\u2019s funny for a Novayan, ay\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNope. Personal project,\u201d I replied, though for a moment, I imagined being up \u2013 alone \u2013 in the astronav dome, and filed that thought away for a while.\n\u201cJoining DSES?\u201d he asked \u2013 referring to the Deep Space Expedition Syndicate. (I didn\u2019t know how seriously to take this question, DSES was still taken as something of a joke at that point in time.)\n\u201cHell no,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been here for hours. You don\u2019t sleep, ay?\u201d\n\u201cCould say the same for you,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe just take naps,\u201d R\u2019Kesh replied. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\u201cI WAS busy! I\u2019m going to have to start this whole thing over!\u201d\nI slammed the book closed and crossed my arms.\n\u201cMaybe eat first, ay?\u201d he said.\nI looked at the package: it was a packaged spicy salmon onigiri. My stomach growled; I hadn\u2019t moved from this spot for hours. I ripped the package open and proceeded to indelicately stuff my face. I wanted to be mad at him for the disruption but by this point, I couldn\u2019t be mad at the person who\u2019d brought me food.\nAfter a long time, after washing all of that down with a bulb of now-cold green tea, I wiped my mouth, and finally looked up at R\u2019Kesh and asked: \u201cFunny for a Novayan?\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cYou said\u2026 having to do the Ansible Problem, is funny for a Novayan.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yes!\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say anything for a while.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just destroy my work for the night so that I\u2019m gonna have to start over, drop that on me, and not tell me about it.\u201d\nHe chuckled. But then, just as quickly, he was solemn. \u201cR\u2019Kesh humbly asks the Sparks\u2019 forgiveness. I will stay out of your space next time you are reading.\u201d\nI crossed my arms again. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you if you tell me why the Ansible Problem is so damned funny to a Novayan!\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, \u201cWalk with me?\u201d\nI grabbed the book off the table, stuffed it in my bag, and crumpled up the foil onigiri wrapper in one hand. \u201cLead the way.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI probably should have just gone back to my hab and gone to bed, but instead, I had walked with this Novayan down to the hydroponics lab. We sat in a corner in the arboretum, huddled against the wall, and he spoke softly and at length.\nI\u2019d already known somewhat about Novayan loresong; it\u2019s something lots of spacers know, we have our superstitions. More spacer custom comes to us from the Novayans than most of the humans in the syndicates want to admit.\nBut most humans don\u2019t take Novayan loresong seriously. Before being close to the brothers, I didn\u2019t know how seriously to take it, myself.\nBut a much more obscure loresong, it turned out, alluded to tunnels through space, through which they\u2019d sailed fairly lower tech ships, and that this is how they settled their world. He sang a couple of the songs he knew - first playing the tune on his blue ocarina, then singing it in Novayan, with an explanation of what each lyric meant.\n[Edit: put some of those lyrics here.]\nAfter some time, he put his ocarina down, and said:\n\u201cWe have no proof, of course. We would not even know how to look now. But any Novayan would love to be the one to find the proof. It\u2019s something any navigator likes to know about. I would love to go through, one day.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be insane if you want to do that.\u201d\n\u201cNnh.\u201d\nWe were quiet for a moment. \n\u201cSo what is the Sparks\u2019 interest in wormholes, then?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cWormholes are the only possible way the ansibles could work. It\u2019s treated like\u2026 junk science. Better people than me have tried. It\u2019s just going to take actual investigation. I hope they get to it before another Machine Plague comes. I\u2019ve seen some of the feeds. Over, over, over. We still don\u2019t have enough empirical data. Not yet. Without that, anything posted to any of the syndicate boards, will just get downvoted into oblivion. And without upvotes, it doesn\u2019t pass to a vote in a syndicate-\u201c\n\u201cNnh. We\u2019ve stayed out of it,\u201d R\u2019Kesh said. \u201cSomehow. Sounds like we are not missing-\u201d\n\u201c-and without a syndicate supermajority, nobody releases the resources or bothers with their time. DSES is the only syn that will give it the time of day, and they\u2019ve got what? A little office on Perimeter Four?\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly have much \u2018deep space\u2019 to go to,\u201d R\u2019Kesh said. \u201cOr much way to get there.\u201d\n\u201cWe? Don\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\u201cAssociate syndic. What do you have against DSES anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThey keep downvoting me. Deleting my forks. One of them even forked my proposal and tried to push it through themselves, with their own ideas.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it WORKS, Vahl!\u201d\nWe didn\u2019t say anything for a while, and finally, we got up.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you, was it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was not me. How many syndicate forums do you post in, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cA lot.\u201d\nSo this is where I stop right here. Because I am getting off on a tangent, and none of this is going to tell you a single goddamned thing about how I ended up trapped on Planet Bullshit and became head of R&D for an aspiring rocket tyrant. Or about a single thing you actually needed to know.\nBut wormholes have something to do with it.\nAnd so does R\u2019Kesh.", "length": 3122}
{"prompt": "Create a TV script for the BBC continuing drama show, 'Casulaity' following this outline... EPISODE BREAK DOWN:RYAN is clearly sucking up to MAX who knows exactly what Ryan is doing and finds it mildly amusing. Irritated, JODIE tries to ignore Max and Ryan and work with RIDA. But when she makes a minor mistake on an NS PATIENT, Ryan can\u2019t help smirking and giving her a dig. Annoyed, Rida snaps at Ryan \u2013 where does he get his kicks from?! But as Max curtly corrects Jodie\u2019s mistake, it\u2019s clear Jodie is frustrated.\nMax takes Jodie aside and asks what her problem is. Jodie scoffs that it\u2019s clear that Max loves being idolised by idiots like Ryan. Stern, Max tells Jodie to stop being so unprofessional \u2013 this is precisely why them working together is a bad idea. But Jodie just stalks off, wanting nothing to do with him. These two are clearly still as at odds as ever.\nJodie throws herself into work but just then the ED doors fly open as a JIMMY (covered in thick, brown mud) is wheeled in... TEDDY explains he\u2019s a mudlarker who\u2019s been scouring the river Avon. He got into difficulty with a rising tide and got pierced on a rusty Roman arrow. Though his stomach is bleeding badly, Jimmy is more worried about his treasure. As Ryan placates Jimmy that his bag is still here, it\u2019s all hands-on deck to treat him... \nMeanwhile, DONNA and DYLAN are working on an NS PATIENT. As they finish up, Dylan tries to ask Donna how she\u2019s doing (after their conversation in ep 29). If she\u2019s struggling with the job then maybe they should talk about it more? But Donna doesn\u2019t want to talk to Dylan any further \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more to be said. Seeing Jimmy the mudlarker, Donna dives in to help out. A concerned Dylan follows. \nIn resus one, with Ryan and Jodie\u2019s help, Dylan and Donna act to treat Jimmy\u2019s injuries. He\u2019s lost a lot of blood and as Jimmy slips in and out of consciousness, the team move quickly to help him. On his best behaviour in front of Donna after one of his professional references was called into question (in episode 27), Ryan offers to clear Jimmy\u2019s belongings away. But as Ryan does so he trips over what looks like an old rock that\u2019s in Jimmy\u2019s box. But as Ryan picks it up and Jodie wonders what it is, a small pin suddenly falls out and Dylan freezes. That\u2019s an unexploded WW2 grenade. (INCITING INCIDENT) Everyone tenses \u2013 what do they do?! (PRE-TITLES) \nDonna hits the panic button which sets off the alarms to evacuate the building (XR B AND C STORIES) and Dylan tells Ryan (who is still holding the bomb) not to move a muscle in case it goes off. As Ryan goes white, Dylan explains that no one should go near Ryan. They all need to stay very, very calm. Dylan rings Max to explain what\u2019s happened and tells him to get the bomb squad here, now! \nMax, who has just been evacuated, is horrified to hear what Dylan is telling him (especially when he learns Jodie is with them too). As he gets CHARLIE to alert the bomb squad, Max\u2019s first thought is to race back in but IAIN, FAITH and the others tell him that\u2019s a mad idea. All he\u2019s doing is putting himself at risk. But it\u2019s clear Max is desperately worried for his daughter. \nMeanwhile, inside, Dylan tells Jodie to get out; the bomb squad will get here soon but she should go, he and Donna can keep an eye on Jimmy and look after Ryan. But Ryan starts to panic. Jodie can\u2019t leave him! Please! Dylan tries to reassure Ryan but just then Jimmy\u2019s machines start to go off. He\u2019s crashing. As Dylan and Donna have to race to treat him, Jodie can see Ryan\u2019s pure fear. Despite their animosity, Jodie steps towards Ryan \u2013 she\u2019s not going anywhere\u2026 she\u2019s staying with him until help comes. Out on Jodie, determined to support Ryan despite the danger. \nOutside the hospital, Max is desperately trying to manage the chaos of the evacuated PATIENTS and STAFF outside the ED whilst simultaneously asking Dylan for updates on the phone \u2013 he\u2019s practically climbing the walls with worry. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s going spare as POLICE start to lock off the sight. Max is hating that there\u2019s nothing he can do to help, but just then JACK arrives (XR B STORY). As Max looks at his injuries, he realises he needs treatment urgently\u2026 desperate to do something and be of some use, Max offers to take Jack inside to treat him.\nMax is talking to the police and urgently telling them that although it\u2019s not entirely safe, he needs to get inside as this boy, Jack, needs treatment. Though Max argues it\u2019s for Jack, we get the sense that Max needs to keep busy to distract from his worry about Jodie. But will Max be able to get in?\nDylan and Donna are treating Jimmy who is going into septic shock (or similar). It\u2019s tough meds but Jodie gets a terrified Ryan to focus on her instead of the flurry around Jimmy. Ryan\u2019s arm is already getting tired but Jodie reminds him that the small movement could trigger the bomb (as Dylan said). Jodie is brilliantly calm as she brings over a table that Ryan can rest his arm on to take the pressure off. Grateful, Ryan tells Jodie that\u2019s helped a bit. Jodie\u2019s plan seems to be working. \nIt\u2019s tense as Max and Faith carefully enter resus three (which is slightly away from where the bomb is and therefore is slightly safer) with Jack and get to work on him (XR B STORY). But all the while, Max keeps the phone line with Dylan open, insisting on continued updates. His mind is clearly on Jodie. \nMeanwhile, Donna and Dylan do some brilliant meds on Jimmy. It\u2019s a wave of relief for them and it gets even better when the BOMB SQUAD finally arrive. Jodie, Donna and Dylan breathe a sigh of relief. Perhaps it will all be ok after all. But are they really out of the woods? \nThe bomb squad examine the device in Ryan\u2019s hand. DAN, the bomb squad leader, confirms that the most important thing is that Ryan doesn\u2019t shift it at all. Impatient, Dylan insists that he\u2019s already told him that. But as Dan explains that they\u2019ll evacuate Jodie, Dylan and Donna and then the bomb squad team can work slowly with Ryan to deactivate the device, Ryan\u2019s panic resurfaces again. He can\u2019t deactivate it, he can\u2019t hold this thing any longer \u2013 please they need to get it off him. Dan tries to reassure Ryan that it\u2019s going to be ok but nothing he says will work. It becomes clear that Ryan is about to let go of the bomb\u2026 and if it falls it may well detonate. But as Dan makes to leap forward to stop Ryan, a hand suddenly closes over Ryan\u2019s: it\u2019s Jodie\u2019s. Jodie has taken the bomb and released Ryan\u2026 Dylan, Donna, Dan and Ryan all reel in shock. (MID-POINT) \nA stunned silence has fallen over everyone in resus one. Ryan is still shaking as he lets his free arm finally fall. Donna looks at Dylan full of worry but Dan takes charge. Dan orders Donna, Dylan and Ryan out. They will take this from here. Dylan and Donna don\u2019t want to leave Jodie but Dan won\u2019t take no for an answer. As Dylan and Donna move towards the door, Ryan looks to Jodie full of guilt and worry but Jodie, who is still holding the bomb, just gives him a small, sad nod. It\u2019s ok, it\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s an unspoken bond between Jodie and Ryan after what Jodie has just done for him. \nMax and Faith are evacuated by the bomb squad (XR B STORY) but are filled with relief to see Dylan, Donna and Ryan are now outside the ED and unharmed. But as Faith hugs Dylan and Donna, Max asks where Jodie is. Dylan takes a deep breath as he explains Jodie is still inside\u2026 Max\u2019s stomach drops. \nMeanwhile, back in resus one, Jodie is now left alone with Dan and the bomb squad. Dan tells Jodie that was a very brave but very stupid thing to do taking the bomb from Ryan. Dan tells Jodie that they\u2019re going to have to work together to try and deactivate the bomb whilst she\u2019s still holding it. Jodie feels sick with fear.\nOutside, Max is reeling, still struggling to understand how Jodie ended up holding the bomb. Desperate, Max grabs another member of the BOMB SQUAD who is overseeing the evacuation and takes his radio. As Max speaks into it\u2026 \n\u2026Jodie hears Max\u2019s voice come out of Dan\u2019s radio. Dan makes to turn it off, but Jodie says it\u2019s ok. Max doesn\u2019t want Jodie deactivating that device, it\u2019s not safe. But a brave Jodie insists it\u2019s ok\u2026 there\u2019s no other way. Strangely, Max\u2019s fear gives Jodie some more fight. Max\u2019s voice is soft as he reassures Jodie that everything will be ok \u2013 he\u2019s here. Though Jodie is still terrified, it\u2019s the encouragement she needs and very slowly she and Dan start to get to work. \nTogether, Dan and Jodie work together, with Max\u2019s encouragement to deactivate the device. Jodie\u2019s heart is in her mouth, whilst outside Max and the team wait with baited breath\u2026 \nVery slowly, Jodie and Dan start to make progress. Dan tells Jodie well done but as he takes the device, something goes wrong. Something in the device shifts\u2026\nAnd suddenly outside, Max and the team hear a huge BANG\u2026\n\u2026Back in resus one, glass smashes and a fire ball rips through the room\u2026 Jodie and Dan are thrown to the floor. The device has gone off. \nAnd without thinking Max runs back into the ED. His mind is on nothing but Jodie as he races through the corridors to get to resus one\u2026 But is he too late? Is his daughter dead? \nBut as Max bursts into resus one, it\u2019s to see Jodie alive and kneeling by Dan who has been injured badly from the blast. With nothing but determination in her eyes, Jodie tells Max that they need to treat Dan \u2013 now! \nAnd Max and Jodie are fantastic as they work to save Dan. Dylan races in too and helps the team. It\u2019s tough meds but Max and Dylan are fantastic with Jodie\u2019s support. As Dan finally is stable, Max tells Jodie to go and get herself looked at. That\u2019s an order. As Jodie walks out, Dylan finally lets out a breath of relief; it\u2019s never dull in this ED, is it?!\nAn hour or so later, the ED is readmitting its remaining patients and is buzzing again. Shaken, Ryan finds Max. Trying to cover his cowardliness, he gushes to Max for how well he did today\u2026 that\u2019s why he wants him to be his mentor. But Max is unimpressed; Ryan nearly killed them! Thinking of nearly losing Jodie, Max loses it at Ryan so much so that Dylan and Donna can\u2019t help reigning Max in: they all went through it today. As Max storms off, Ryan is upset by Max\u2019s treatment of him. \nAs Dylan and Donna recover from the day\u2019s events, Dylan tells Donna that she was fantastic today. Surely that\u2019s made her realise how fantastic she is for this job? Donna forces a smile but there\u2019s a sense that all this has done is spook her more. Is Donna losing her love of nursing even more?\nMeanwhile, Jodie is recovering from the bomb scare when Ryan finds her. He can\u2019t even look her in the eye as he awkwardly thanks her for taking the bomb. He knows he hasn\u2019t always been great to her but he hopes after this they can be friends. Jodie is touched to see this side to Ryan and nods \u2013 she\u2019d like that. But as Ryan reckons Max was pretty awesome today too bravely coming into the room, Jodie hides her grimace. Evidently the day\u2019s events haven\u2019t changed her mind about Max. \nLater, Max finds Jodie and tries to reach out \u2013 is she ok after today? But Jodie tells Max that today\u2019s events don\u2019t change anything. He clearly just loves to act the hero. As Jodie tells Max to stay away from her\u2026 she doesn\u2019t realise that Ryan has seen the exchange. Ryan\u2019s eyes narrow\u2026 \nJodie checks in on Jimmy and he gives her one of the treasures he found, he\u2019s grateful for everything she did earlier... but she\u2019s caught off guard as Ryan confronts her; is she sleeping with Max? Jodie is quick and firm to deny, but as she leaves it\u2019s clear that Ryan is riled \u2013 he\u2019s not going to drop this, he knows what he saw. Clearly any friendship between Ryan and Jodie has gone for good. (HOOK)", "length": 3297}
{"prompt": "Create a TV episode screenplay for the BBC continuing drama show, 'Casulaity' following this outline... EPISODE BREAK DOWN: RYAN is clearly sucking up to MAX who knows exactly what Ryan is doing and finds it mildly amusing. Irritated, JODIE tries to ignore Max and Ryan and work with RIDA. But when she makes a minor mistake on an NS PATIENT, Ryan can\u2019t help smirking and giving her a dig. Annoyed, Rida snaps at Ryan \u2013 where does he get his kicks from?! But as Max curtly corrects Jodie\u2019s mistake, it\u2019s clear Jodie is frustrated.\nMax takes Jodie aside and asks what her problem is. Jodie scoffs that it\u2019s clear that Max loves being idolised by idiots like Ryan. Stern, Max tells Jodie to stop being so unprofessional \u2013 this is precisely why them working together is a bad idea. But Jodie just stalks off, wanting nothing to do with him. These two are clearly still as at odds as ever.\nJodie throws herself into work but just then the ED doors fly open as a JIMMY (covered in thick, brown mud) is wheeled in... TEDDY explains he\u2019s a mudlarker who\u2019s been scouring the river Avon. He got into difficulty with a rising tide and got pierced on a rusty Roman arrow. Though his stomach is bleeding badly, Jimmy is more worried about his treasure. As Ryan placates Jimmy that his bag is still here, it\u2019s all hands-on deck to treat him... \nMeanwhile, DONNA and DYLAN are working on an NS PATIENT. As they finish up, Dylan tries to ask Donna how she\u2019s doing (after their conversation in ep 29). If she\u2019s struggling with the job then maybe they should talk about it more? But Donna doesn\u2019t want to talk to Dylan any further \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more to be said. Seeing Jimmy the mudlarker, Donna dives in to help out. A concerned Dylan follows. \nIn resus one, with Ryan and Jodie\u2019s help, Dylan and Donna act to treat Jimmy\u2019s injuries. He\u2019s lost a lot of blood and as Jimmy slips in and out of consciousness, the team move quickly to help him. On his best behaviour in front of Donna after one of his professional references was called into question (in episode 27), Ryan offers to clear Jimmy\u2019s belongings away. But as Ryan does so he trips over what looks like an old rock that\u2019s in Jimmy\u2019s box. But as Ryan picks it up and Jodie wonders what it is, a small pin suddenly falls out and Dylan freezes. That\u2019s an unexploded WW2 grenade. (INCITING INCIDENT) Everyone tenses \u2013 what do they do?! (PRE-TITLES) \nDonna hits the panic button which sets off the alarms to evacuate the building (XR B AND C STORIES) and Dylan tells Ryan (who is still holding the bomb) not to move a muscle in case it goes off. As Ryan goes white, Dylan explains that no one should go near Ryan. They all need to stay very, very calm. Dylan rings Max to explain what\u2019s happened and tells him to get the bomb squad here, now! \nMax, who has just been evacuated, is horrified to hear what Dylan is telling him (especially when he learns Jodie is with them too). As he gets CHARLIE to alert the bomb squad, Max\u2019s first thought is to race back in but IAIN, FAITH and the others tell him that\u2019s a mad idea. All he\u2019s doing is putting himself at risk. But it\u2019s clear Max is desperately worried for his daughter. \nMeanwhile, inside, Dylan tells Jodie to get out; the bomb squad will get here soon but she should go, he and Donna can keep an eye on Jimmy and look after Ryan. But Ryan starts to panic. Jodie can\u2019t leave him! Please! Dylan tries to reassure Ryan but just then Jimmy\u2019s machines start to go off. He\u2019s crashing. As Dylan and Donna have to race to treat him, Jodie can see Ryan\u2019s pure fear. Despite their animosity, Jodie steps towards Ryan \u2013 she\u2019s not going anywhere\u2026 she\u2019s staying with him until help comes. Out on Jodie, determined to support Ryan despite the danger. \nOutside the hospital, Max is desperately trying to manage the chaos of the evacuated PATIENTS and STAFF outside the ED whilst simultaneously asking Dylan for updates on the phone \u2013 he\u2019s practically climbing the walls with worry. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s going spare as POLICE start to lock off the sight. Max is hating that there\u2019s nothing he can do to help, but just then JACK arrives (XR B STORY). As Max looks at his injuries, he realises he needs treatment urgently\u2026 desperate to do something and be of some use, Max offers to take Jack inside to treat him.\nMax is talking to the police and urgently telling them that although it\u2019s not entirely safe, he needs to get inside as this boy, Jack, needs treatment. Though Max argues it\u2019s for Jack, we get the sense that Max needs to keep busy to distract from his worry about Jodie. But will Max be able to get in?\nDylan and Donna are treating Jimmy who is going into septic shock (or similar). It\u2019s tough meds but Jodie gets a terrified Ryan to focus on her instead of the flurry around Jimmy. Ryan\u2019s arm is already getting tired but Jodie reminds him that the small movement could trigger the bomb (as Dylan said). Jodie is brilliantly calm as she brings over a table that Ryan can rest his arm on to take the pressure off. Grateful, Ryan tells Jodie that\u2019s helped a bit. Jodie\u2019s plan seems to be working. \nIt\u2019s tense as Max and Faith carefully enter resus three (which is slightly away from where the bomb is and therefore is slightly safer) with Jack and get to work on him (XR B STORY). But all the while, Max keeps the phone line with Dylan open, insisting on continued updates. His mind is clearly on Jodie. \nMeanwhile, Donna and Dylan do some brilliant meds on Jimmy. It\u2019s a wave of relief for them and it gets even better when the BOMB SQUAD finally arrive. Jodie, Donna and Dylan breathe a sigh of relief. Perhaps it will all be ok after all. But are they really out of the woods? \nThe bomb squad examine the device in Ryan\u2019s hand. DAN, the bomb squad leader, confirms that the most important thing is that Ryan doesn\u2019t shift it at all. Impatient, Dylan insists that he\u2019s already told him that. But as Dan explains that they\u2019ll evacuate Jodie, Dylan and Donna and then the bomb squad team can work slowly with Ryan to deactivate the device, Ryan\u2019s panic resurfaces again. He can\u2019t deactivate it, he can\u2019t hold this thing any longer \u2013 please they need to get it off him. Dan tries to reassure Ryan that it\u2019s going to be ok but nothing he says will work. It becomes clear that Ryan is about to let go of the bomb\u2026 and if it falls it may well detonate. But as Dan makes to leap forward to stop Ryan, a hand suddenly closes over Ryan\u2019s: it\u2019s Jodie\u2019s. Jodie has taken the bomb and released Ryan\u2026 Dylan, Donna, Dan and Ryan all reel in shock. (MID-POINT) \nA stunned silence has fallen over everyone in resus one. Ryan is still shaking as he lets his free arm finally fall. Donna looks at Dylan full of worry but Dan takes charge. Dan orders Donna, Dylan and Ryan out. They will take this from here. Dylan and Donna don\u2019t want to leave Jodie but Dan won\u2019t take no for an answer. As Dylan and Donna move towards the door, Ryan looks to Jodie full of guilt and worry but Jodie, who is still holding the bomb, just gives him a small, sad nod. It\u2019s ok, it\u2019ll be fine.

{"prompt": "Create a tv screenplay with dialogue for the BBC continuing drama show 'Casualty', following this outline... RYAN is clearly sucking up to MAX who knows exactly what Ryan is doing and finds it mildly amusing. Irritated, JODIE tries to ignore Max and Ryan and work with RIDA. But when she makes a minor mistake on an NS PATIENT, Ryan can\u2019t help smirking and giving her a dig. Annoyed, Rida snaps at Ryan \u2013 where does he get his kicks from?! But as Max curtly corrects Jodie\u2019s mistake, it\u2019s clear Jodie is frustrated.\nMax takes Jodie aside and asks what her problem is. Jodie scoffs that it\u2019s clear that Max loves being idolised by idiots like Ryan. Stern, Max tells Jodie to stop being so unprofessional \u2013 this is precisely why them working together is a bad idea. But Jodie just stalks off, wanting nothing to do with him. These two are clearly still as at odds as ever.\nJodie throws herself into work but just then the ED doors fly open as a JIMMY (covered in thick, brown mud) is wheeled in... TEDDY explains he\u2019s a mudlarker who\u2019s been scouring the river Avon. He got into difficulty with a rising tide and got pierced on a rusty Roman arrow. Though his stomach is bleeding badly, Jimmy is more worried about his treasure. As Ryan placates Jimmy that his bag is still here, it\u2019s all hands-on deck to treat him... \nMeanwhile, DONNA and DYLAN are working on an NS PATIENT. As they finish up, Dylan tries to ask Donna how she\u2019s doing (after their conversation in ep 29). If she\u2019s struggling with the job then maybe they should talk about it more? But Donna doesn\u2019t want to talk to Dylan any further \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more to be said. Seeing Jimmy the mudlarker, Donna dives in to help out. A concerned Dylan follows. \nIn resus one, with Ryan and Jodie\u2019s help, Dylan and Donna act to treat Jimmy\u2019s injuries. He\u2019s lost a lot of blood and as Jimmy slips in and out of consciousness, the team move quickly to help him. On his best behaviour in front of Donna after one of his professional references was called into question (in episode 27), Ryan offers to clear Jimmy\u2019s belongings away. But as Ryan does so he trips over what looks like an old rock that\u2019s in Jimmy\u2019s box. But as Ryan picks it up and Jodie wonders what it is, a small pin suddenly falls out and Dylan freezes. That\u2019s an unexploded WW2 grenade. (INCITING INCIDENT) Everyone tenses \u2013 what do they do?! (PRE-TITLES) \nDonna hits the panic button which sets off the alarms to evacuate the building (XR B AND C STORIES) and Dylan tells Ryan (who is still holding the bomb) not to move a muscle in case it goes off. As Ryan goes white, Dylan explains that no one should go near Ryan. They all need to stay very, very calm. Dylan rings Max to explain what\u2019s happened and tells him to get the bomb squad here, now! \nMax, who has just been evacuated, is horrified to hear what Dylan is telling him (especially when he learns Jodie is with them too). As he gets CHARLIE to alert the bomb squad, Max\u2019s first thought is to race back in but IAIN, FAITH and the others tell him that\u2019s a mad idea. All he\u2019s doing is putting himself at risk. But it\u2019s clear Max is desperately worried for his daughter. \nMeanwhile, inside, Dylan tells Jodie to get out; the bomb squad will get here soon but she should go, he and Donna can keep an eye on Jimmy and look after Ryan. But Ryan starts to panic. Jodie can\u2019t leave him! Please! Dylan tries to reassure Ryan but just then Jimmy\u2019s machines start to go off. He\u2019s crashing. As Dylan and Donna have to race to treat him, Jodie can see Ryan\u2019s pure fear. Despite their animosity, Jodie steps towards Ryan \u2013 she\u2019s not going anywhere\u2026 she\u2019s staying with him until help comes. Out on Jodie, determined to support Ryan despite the danger. \nOutside the hospital, Max is desperately trying to manage the chaos of the evacuated PATIENTS and STAFF outside the ED whilst simultaneously asking Dylan for updates on the phone \u2013 he\u2019s practically climbing the walls with worry. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s going spare as POLICE start to lock off the sight. Max is hating that there\u2019s nothing he can do to help, but just then JACK arrives (XR B STORY). As Max looks at his injuries, he realises he needs treatment urgently\u2026 desperate to do something and be of some use, Max offers to take Jack inside to treat him.\nMax is talking to the police and urgently telling them that although it\u2019s not entirely safe, he needs to get inside as this boy, Jack, needs treatment. Though Max argues it\u2019s for Jack, we get the sense that Max needs to keep busy to distract from his worry about Jodie. But will Max be able to get in?\nDylan and Donna are treating Jimmy who is going into septic shock (or similar). It\u2019s tough meds but Jodie gets a terrified Ryan to focus on her instead of the flurry around Jimmy. Ryan\u2019s arm is already getting tired but Jodie reminds him that the small movement could trigger the bomb (as Dylan said). Jodie is brilliantly calm as she brings over a table that Ryan can rest his arm on to take the pressure off. Grateful, Ryan tells Jodie that\u2019s helped a bit. Jodie\u2019s plan seems to be working. \nIt\u2019s tense as Max and Faith carefully enter resus three (which is slightly away from where the bomb is and therefore is slightly safer) with Jack and get to work on him (XR B STORY). But all the while, Max keeps the phone line with Dylan open, insisting on continued updates. His mind is clearly on Jodie. \nMeanwhile, Donna and Dylan do some brilliant meds on Jimmy. It\u2019s a wave of relief for them and it gets even better when the BOMB SQUAD finally arrive. Jodie, Donna and Dylan breathe a sigh of relief. Perhaps it will all be ok after all. But are they really out of the woods? \nThe bomb squad examine the device in Ryan\u2019s hand. DAN, the bomb squad leader, confirms that the most important thing is that Ryan doesn\u2019t shift it at all. Impatient, Dylan insists that he\u2019s already told him that. But as Dan explains that they\u2019ll evacuate Jodie, Dylan and Donna and then the bomb squad team can work slowly with Ryan to deactivate the device, Ryan\u2019s panic resurfaces again. He can\u2019t deactivate it, he can\u2019t hold this thing any longer \u2013 please they need to get it off him. Dan tries to reassure Ryan that it\u2019s going to be ok but nothing he says will work. It becomes clear that Ryan is about to let go of the bomb\u2026 and if it falls it may well detonate. But as Dan makes to leap forward to stop Ryan, a hand suddenly closes over Ryan\u2019s: it\u2019s Jodie\u2019s. Jodie has taken the bomb and released Ryan\u2026 Dylan, Donna, Dan and Ryan all reel in shock. (MID-POINT) \nA stunned silence has fallen over everyone in resus one. Ryan is still shaking as he lets his free arm finally fall. Donna looks at Dylan full of worry but Dan takes charge. Dan orders Donna, Dylan and Ryan out. They will take this from here. Dylan and Donna don\u2019t want to leave Jodie but Dan won\u2019t take no for an answer. As Dylan and Donna move towards the door, Ryan looks to Jodie full of guilt and worry but Jodie, who is still holding the bomb, just gives him a small, sad nod. It\u2019s ok, it\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s an unspoken bond between Jodie and Ryan after what Jodie has just done for him. \nMax and Faith are evacuated by the bomb squad (XR B STORY) but are filled with relief to see Dylan, Donna and Ryan are now outside the ED and unharmed. But as Faith hugs Dylan and Donna, Max asks where Jodie is. Dylan takes a deep breath as he explains Jodie is still inside\u2026 Max\u2019s stomach drops. \nMeanwhile, back in resus one, Jodie is now left alone with Dan and the bomb squad. Dan tells Jodie that was a very brave but very stupid thing to do taking the bomb from Ryan. Dan tells Jodie that they\u2019re going to have to work together to try and deactivate the bomb whilst she\u2019s still holding it. Jodie feels sick with fear.\nOutside, Max is reeling, still struggling to understand how Jodie ended up holding the bomb. Desperate, Max grabs another member of the BOMB SQUAD who is overseeing the evacuation and takes his radio. As Max speaks into it\u2026 \n\u2026Jodie hears Max\u2019s voice come out of Dan\u2019s radio. Dan makes to turn it off, but Jodie says it\u2019s ok. Max doesn\u2019t want Jodie deactivating that device, it\u2019s not safe. But a brave Jodie insists it\u2019s ok\u2026 there\u2019s no other way. Strangely, Max\u2019s fear gives Jodie some more fight. Max\u2019s voice is soft as he reassures Jodie that everything will be ok \u2013 he\u2019s here. Though Jodie is still terrified, it\u2019s the encouragement she needs and very slowly she and Dan start to get to work. \nTogether, Dan and Jodie work together, with Max\u2019s encouragement to deactivate the device. Jodie\u2019s heart is in her mouth, whilst outside Max and the team wait with baited breath\u2026 \nVery slowly, Jodie and Dan start to make progress. Dan tells Jodie well done but as he takes the device, something goes wrong. Something in the device shifts\u2026\nAnd suddenly outside, Max and the team hear a huge BANG\u2026\n\u2026Back in resus one, glass smashes and a fire ball rips through the room\u2026 Jodie and Dan are thrown to the floor. The device has gone off. \nAnd without thinking Max runs back into the ED. His mind is on nothing but Jodie as he races through the corridors to get to resus one\u2026 But is he too late? Is his daughter dead? \nBut as Max bursts into resus one, it\u2019s to see Jodie alive and kneeling by Dan who has been injured badly from the blast. With nothing but determination in her eyes, Jodie tells Max that they need to treat Dan \u2013 now! \nAnd Max and Jodie are fantastic as they work to save Dan. Dylan races in too and helps the team. It\u2019s tough meds but Max and Dylan are fantastic with Jodie\u2019s support. As Dan finally is stable, Max tells Jodie to go and get herself looked at. That\u2019s an order. As Jodie walks out, Dylan finally lets out a breath of relief; it\u2019s never dull in this ED, is it?!\nAn hour or so later, the ED is readmitting its remaining patients and is buzzing again. Shaken, Ryan finds Max. Trying to cover his cowardliness, he gushes to Max for how well he did today\u2026 that\u2019s why he wants him to be his mentor. But Max is unimpressed; Ryan nearly killed them! Thinking of nearly losing Jodie, Max loses it at Ryan so much so that Dylan and Donna can\u2019t help reigning Max in: they all went through it today. As Max storms off, Ryan is upset by Max\u2019s treatment of him. \nAs Dylan and Donna recover from the day\u2019s events, Dylan tells Donna that she was fantastic today. Surely that\u2019s made her realise how fantastic she is for this job? Donna forces a smile but there\u2019s a sense that all this has done is spook her more. Is Donna losing her love of nursing even more?\nMeanwhile, Jodie is recovering from the bomb scare when Ryan finds her. He can\u2019t even look her in the eye as he awkwardly thanks her for taking the bomb. He knows he hasn\u2019t always been great to her but he hopes after this they can be friends.

This information should be included in the first\nsentence.\n\u2022 There should be a general description to your reader.\nThat is, what should I be focused on in the picture(s)?\nThe photo will be graded on the evidence of a crime\nprevention strategy, how clear the strategy is, and its\noriginality (taken by you).\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 13\nA) Photo & Details (cont\u2019d)\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 14\nCC100 3/13/23\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 8\nRubric\n(Excellent)\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023\n\u2022 Picture(s) clearly connects to the\ntopic at hand (CP). Demonstrates\nclear understanding of the purpose\nof this assignment. Photo details\nhave been provided (location, date\nand time). A general brief\ndescription is provided to the\nreader. Creativity and originality\nare evident. Photo was taken this\nschool year. [your pics should not\nbe the same as any other student\u2019s\npics] 15\nB) Strategy Type & CP (10 marks)\n\u2022 Begin this paragraph by identifying the strategy (i.e.,\nsurveillance or access control).\n\u2022 Why is it this type of strategy? Make sure to explain\nyour reasoning by making explicit connections to the\nliterature (textbook and lecture) on these CPTED\nstrategies and to parts of the photo where this is\nexhibited.\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 16\nCC100 3/13/23\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 9\nB) Strategy Type & CP (cont\u2019d)\n\u2022 All relevant factors should be discussed and\nconnected to the details from your picture to provide\nevidence and will be evaluated on this. No online\nsources should be used in this section.\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 17\nB) Strategy Type & CP (cont\u2019d)\n\u2022 Additionally, tell the reader how it is preventing crime.\nBe specific and explicit.\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 18\nCC100 3/13/23\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023 10\nRubric I\n(Excellent)\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023\n\u2022 Correctly identifies the type of\nstrategy used (presented in the\nphoto) and whether it is natural or\nmechanical. Explains clearly why\nthis strategy is exemplary. Excellent\nwork in explaining why the strategy\nis applicable by using evidence\nfrom the photo(s) and connecting\nit to the literature on this strategy.\nInformation and evidence are\naccurate, appropriate, and\nintegrated effectively. 19\nRubric II\n(Excellent)\n\u00a9 Michelle Dumas 2023\n\u2022 This fits the criteria of a\nsurveillance or access control\nstrategy.\n\u2022 Excellent discussion of the\nways that crime has been\nprevented by this strategy\nwith clear connections to the\nphoto(s). Clear and concise\nexplanations. 20\nA) Photo & Details (cont'd)\n\u2022 Picture(s) - should be clear how crime is being prevented; if you need more than one pic, include more than one\n\u2022 Mav need more than one - from different angles or close-ups/further back (for context) to back-up arguments\n\u2022Originality: Your pictures should not look like any other students in the class - if vou submit the same thing as another student, you will both receive a zeroPhoto & Details (cont'd)\n\u2022It should have required details:\nneighbourhood/city, time of day & date - this should be in first sentence of first paragraph\n\u2022Description: brief/general - tell me what to look at or what I'm looking at, in case it is not obvious (it is not always obviousB) Strategy Type & CP (cont'd)\n\u2022One way to do this: start with literature (cite in APA) - tell me a descriptor of the strategy and tell me where that is exemplified in the picture; then move to another element & tell me where that is in the picture\n(etc.)Strategy Type & CP (cont'd)\n\u2022Additionally, tell the reader how it is preventing crime.\nBe specific and explicit. (smaller part of this section)\n\u2022 That is, how do you believe they are stopping crime from happening?\n\u2022 Be specific! Spell it out for me (as if I do not know)\n\u2022 You can use lecture & text to back this upEvaluation\n\u2022This is all about your thoughts on it. There is no right or wrong way to answer this - but you need to back up your arguments.\n\u2022 Do you think this strategy works in this neighbourhood? [key] Why or why not?\n[consider where it is being used)\n\u2022What improvement could help prevent crime even more?
